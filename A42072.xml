            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>An indifferent man of any Nation under heaven could not deny but that <hi>this Booke</hi> throughout, diſcovereth an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible ſecret power and excellency; enabled to make any man whatſoever, <hi>wiſe to Salvation.</hi> And that Canon of it which is undoubtedly received on all hands, is ſufficiently <hi>entire.</hi>

                  <p>You muſt not reckon of the Scripture by the bulk. It were the biggeſt Book in the world if it were leſſe then it is, and it was purpoſely fixed to that proportion it hath, that it might compare and comply with our Size and Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>If you would have all written that <hi>Solomon</hi> diſputed from the <hi>Cedar</hi> in <hi>Libanus</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop</hi> that growes upon the wall; or all that which was done and ſaid by One that was Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he, and ſpake as never man did, <hi>The world it ſelfe would not be able to containe the Bookes that ſhould be written, Amen,</hi> that is, <hi>The Lord let it be ſo as it is.</hi>

                  <p>¶ It will not be ſo ſucceſſeful an argument for this Book to

And <hi>David</hi> ſaid—<hi>from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſeeing that the mighty in</hi> Iſrael <hi>are</hi> falne, it <hi>will be neceſſary</hi> that <hi>the men of Judah</hi> learne to exerciſe their armes, and <hi>to draw the bow. Levi ben Gerſom</hi> ſaith that <hi>inaſmuch as David ſaw that the death of Saul was cauſed by his feare of the Bowmen, and that there was none in Iſrael skill'd in this kinde of</hi> Artillery, he <hi>gave order</hi> that the <hi>men</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> (as <hi>being</hi> the <hi>principall men</hi> at <hi>Armes</hi>) (<hi>ſhould be</hi> taught the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>the Bow, &amp;c.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe <hi>R.

Iſay</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Saul and Jonathan taught the ſonnes of Judah the bow,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſonnes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58600:18"/> of Judah were mighty men, and fit to draw the Bow by the bleſſing of Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.8. Where it is prophecied that the hand of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be in the neck of his Enemies, that is, (ſaith <hi>Chimhi</hi> as ſome of our <hi>wiſemen</hi> expound) <hi>the Bow.</hi> Therefore they take the <hi>Booke of Jaſher</hi> to be the firſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in which the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> the <hi>Jeſharim,</hi> or upright men are recorded; but eſpecially they take the Booke to be <hi>Beracoth Jacob,</hi> or the <hi>Bleſſings of Jacob.</hi> Thus the Jewes.</p>
                     <p>Though we have <hi>wiſemen</hi> of our own to follow them in the Interpretation of the <hi>Bow:</hi> yet they will appeare to be as idle in <hi>this,</hi> as in their conceipt of the <hi>booke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is it a thing to be thought that the men of <hi>Judah</hi> were now to learne the uſe of the Bow? 'Twas the common Tactick practiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Hebraiſme of Bow is like that of Bread: It nameth for all other kinde of Ammunition. And where's the conſequence here that becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> (excellent Archers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Bow of <hi>Jonathan</hi> turned not back) fell downe before the Arrowes of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> that therefore the men of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be taught the uſe of the Bow? But the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is worſe. And <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Author of the Booke bringeth <hi>David</hi> in beginning an <hi>epicedium</hi> upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and immediately breaketh him off with an impertinent command to the ſons of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they ſhould learne to handle the Bow. And where is it, or why is it that this <hi>ſhould be written in the Booke of Iaſhar?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Mariana</hi> very underſtandly ſtept aſide out of the common Road of Interpretation, and conſidered with himſelfe that the Bow here might be taken for the Title of the Song, which cannot be ſtrange to them that will compare this with the granted ſuperſcriptions upon <hi>David's</hi> Pſalmes, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. To the chiefe Muſitian upon <hi>Shoſhannim. Pſal.</hi> 67. Upon <hi>Neginoth. Pſal.</hi> 59.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58600:18"/> chiefe Muſitians, <hi>Heman, Ethan,</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> to teach the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people how to ſing this Lamentation of <hi>David</hi> upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> It was intituled <hi>Keſheth,</hi> or the Bow, becauſe it was occaſioned by the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> Archers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.3. But eſpecially reſpecting to the Bow of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not back from the bloud of the ſlaine, as the Song it ſelf expreſſeth. And <hi>David</hi> could not but remember the Bow of <hi>Ionathan</hi> out of which <hi>that Arrow was ſhot beyond the Lad,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.36. It was the time when that Covenant was made, and that affection expreſſed betwixt them which was greater then the love of women.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis ſaid there too that <hi>David</hi> exceeded, <hi>v.</hi> 41. And there alſo <hi>Ionathan</hi> required that this kindneſſe of the Lord ſhould be ſhewed unto him longer then he lived. <hi>And thou ſhalt not only whileſt yet I live, &amp;c. v.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>The Lxx will beare out this Interpretation. The verſion there is, <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis true the late Editions of this Tranſlation have ſhifted in the word <hi>Arcum</hi> inſtead of <hi>Planctum.</hi> But in the ancient Manuſcripts it is ſo as I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. And in the Elder printed copies 'tis <hi>Arcum,</hi> but in the Margin onely which afterwards crept into the Text, if I may call the Tranſlation ſo.</p>
                     <p>Therefore alſo by theſe two great Authorities that which the Sonnes of <hi>Iudah</hi> were commanded to learne was not the uſe of the Bow. But the Bow, as 'tis originally ſet down, that is, a Song of <hi>David</hi> ſo called, or this Song of Lamentation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan.</hi> And this is that which was written in the Booke of <hi>Iaſher.</hi> Why this Booke was ſo called, or who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58600:19"/> was the Author of it, I cannot tell you. That it was not the firſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as the Rabbines would have it) is ridiculouſly plaine. <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath let us know thus much that it was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple,</hi> and you muſt not thinke it hard if it be loſt to us as yet, you ſhall heare more of this hereafter. It is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twice in Scripture, here and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. And if both places be conſidered, 'tis to be judg'd that nothing was recorded in this Booke but Memorialls of this kinde, and which is more to be noted, they were metricall too. The place in <hi>Joſhua</hi> put to this here maketh it cleare. There it is quoted out of the Booke of <hi>Jaſher,</hi> that the Sun ſtood ſtill in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moone in the valley of <hi>Ajalon.</hi> This Quotation is a plaine Canticle. <hi>Chimhi</hi> commeth ſo neare to the matter, as onely to make a doubt of it. But the thing is certain, It is reckoned among the 10 Songs by the Mechilta an old Commentary upon <hi>Exodus</hi> to the 15 Chapter. The 4 is that of <hi>Moſes</hi> before his deceaſe: and the 6 is that of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and this of <hi>Joſhua</hi> is the fifth. I would ſay more of this had not the learned <hi>Maſius</hi> prevented me upon the place, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. This is enough to ſhew that the Song of the Bow might, but the uſe of it could not be ſet downe in the Booke of <hi>Jaſher.</hi> It is certaine that this command of <hi>David</hi> to the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> is not delivered in Meeter. Indeed matter of that kinde was no fit ſubject for a Song. And now 'tis come to <hi>Tyndalls</hi> turne againe, for the <hi>New</hi> muſt be corrected by his <hi>Old Tranſlation.</hi> He rendered thus, <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſang this Song of Mourning over</hi> Saul <hi>and over</hi> Jonathan <hi>his Sonne, and bade to teach the Children of Iſrael the Staves thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I may note one thing more, and I marvaile at it too, that the vulgar Edition hath one verſe over and above in the Canticle of the Bow. <hi>Conſidera Iſrael pro his qui mortui ſunt, ſuper excelſa tua vulnerati.</hi> It ſeemeth to pretend as if it would tranſlate the firſt verſe of the Song; but that's done, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too, immediately in the next, <hi>Jnclyti Iſrael ſuper Montes tuos interfecti tunt. Quomodo ceciderunt fortos?</hi> I found it ſo in ſome of the written as well as the printed Copies: And yet I think <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> did better to leave it out, then ſome others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58600:19"/> ſince to keep it in. It is plainly void and ſupernumerary, and an eſcape not fit to be accounted upon the Sageneſſe of that tranſlation.</p>

                     <p>And as it would ſeem to be by the Jewes, our Saviour might not himſelfe make uſe of this Name in kinde: for after their malicious rate of Tradition, they hold that he did all his miracles by the <hi>Paraphraſticall Tetragrammaton,</hi> or <hi>Shem ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoraſh</hi> (as they call this Name at length and in other words) and this way of Enunciation they ſay was cut into his feet, and produced as occaſion ſerved, as to caſt out Devills (by a knowne Receſſe of the blacke Art) through <hi>him that is the Prince.</hi> And to exalt and make up the Legend they can afford his mother (the bleſſed Virgin to us, and very well ſpoken of in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelfe) no better language then that ſhe was a cunning woman, and brought this kinde of Legerdemain out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <p>Now this Name of <hi>Elohim</hi> is not proper to God, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with the Creature. The Angels are called ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.8.

                     <p>Therefore our Saviour (in the caſe he was) cryed not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova Jehova:</hi> (much leſſe Father, as at other times) but <hi>Eli Eli,</hi> or <hi>Eloi Eloi,</hi> My God, My God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as naming the Judge of all the world, and doing the extreameſt right upon his own Sonne treading the Winepreſſe alone under the perſon of all Mankinde.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now this very thing is a caſe of the <hi>Kibla</hi> or term of adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is fully concern'd, not onely in the whole frame of outward worſhip, but alſo in the ſituation of Temples and Poſition of the Dead. But for this I remit you to another Tract which wanteth not much of my laſt hand.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that the Jewes and they had once the very ſame <hi>Kibla,</hi> and now have the ſame by imitation, that which is pretended to, is of eaſie conſequence.</p>
                     <p>I inferre upon this, that it was an old Jewiſh funerall rite to carry up their dead bodies (after they were waſhed) into ſuch a place where they might beſt compoſe them in the religious poſture, with their Face and Feet toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the upper Roome into which <hi>Tabitha</hi> was carryed up, was the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> of the Houſe. It is not to be miſtaken as if ſhe had been carryed up thither to this end that ſhe might be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Rites of her Funerall were now to be Chriſtian. It was to lay her out ſo that her Face and Feete might be turned towards the Eaſt, which might be in that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Roome, for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was Eaſt from <hi>Ioppa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was forced for the preſent to make uſe of this way of proof, becauſe I could not be fully enough ſatisfied as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58600:27"/> the Jewiſh Rite in the poſition of their dead. <hi>Schickard</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he knew not ſo much though he liv'd amongſt them.

                     <p>And when I conſider how great a man the Jew <hi>Joſephus</hi> was in the Emperours Court, and that he ſerved him preſently, and famouſly in the Action, before the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to imagine who it was that had a hand in the <hi>Device.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>God in the beginning (as <hi>Mercator</hi> deviſeth) ſtrucke a Center in the <hi>Tohue</hi> or <hi>Inane,</hi> indued with that quality as might call unto the congeniall parts of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> which immediately applying themſelves gathered into this Globe.

                     <p>The thing is certain from the conformity of the Needle, to the Axis of the Earth in all parts of the world.</p>
                     <p>From the Reaſons of variation (and the variation of that too) cauſed by an unequall proportion of this <hi>Magneticall</hi> force in ſeverall parts of the <hi>Globe;</hi>

                     <p>'Twas a marke of repented Murther, it pointed out the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God enough, but his mercy more. The vengeance ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have meant his Death by the ſame violence, but by a long expected and accidentall hand. The Myſterie of the marke was of eaſie tradition from one to another, for the world was not ſo preſently numerous. The ſentence of it ſelfe went forth ſevere enough, but was not given to ſtand all. He was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a Vagabond and a Runnagate, but you finde him in the next verſe getting of Children, and building of Cities. And by the greateſt Man in the Eaſt of his Time. It is to be thought that it was a cuſtome of thoſe parts for the Head of the Family to offer up ſet and ſolemne extraordinaey Sacrifices for the Children; for <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>It may be that my Sonnes have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and curſed God in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job. 1 5.</note> And therefore I thinke it not unlikely that <hi>Adam</hi> the High Prieſt of the World then, ſhould doe his uttermoſt to make an atonement for this Bloud. <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that he was quitted of the Murther by Sacrifice, but he ſaith too, what no man yet hath beleeved, that it was by his owne.</p>
                     <p>I know not how to account his long life a downe right pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but indulged by the mercy of God, and neceſſary to the multiplication of mankinde. As the Greater before, ſo the Leſſer Worlds now were but in their Chaos, till the Soule of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was infuſed, and then they became a politicke <hi>Living thing.</hi> 'Twas <hi>Cain</hi> that firſt built a City, and called it after the name of his ſonne <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I cannot impute his invention of Arts to the Curſe. Though ſimplicity of Living might become a new made world, and the beginnings of things; yet the growth towards a Common-wealth and ſtature of People, required an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt homelineſſe by a device of crafts and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>I conceive no great matter in this, that <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the preſence of the Lord. So did <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> too. But <hi>Cain</hi> went and dwelt in the <hi>Land of Nod.</hi> And <hi>Abarbinel</hi>

                     <p>The greateſt part of <hi>Cain</hi>'s curſe lay in this, that there was a ſeparation betwixt him and the Faithfull Church of that time, concluded up in the family of <hi>Seth, Said Aben Batric</hi> ſaith (Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as they are quoted in the <hi>Catena Arabica</hi>) that our Father <hi>Adam</hi> after the Fall retired himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Mountaine of <hi>India</hi> called the Holy Mountaine, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that from this Mountaine one ſhould aſcend, and another goe downe; He meant <hi>Henoch</hi> by the firſt.

                     <p>TO redeeme this place (and many other equally engaged) from the <hi>received ſenſe:</hi> I muſt needs lay downe this new ground.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>ſpeciall preſence</hi> of God ever was and is in that part of the Heaven of Heavens which anſwereth to the <hi>Equinoctiall Eaſt</hi> of the Holy land.</p>

But I am ſure he is otherwiſe preſent in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> than in <hi>Hell,</hi> and ſo otherwiſe in one part of Heaven, then in another.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be thought, as if there were an <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt</hi> point in that place which needeth not the Sunne or Moone to ſhine upon it.

                     <p>In the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Temple, The Glory of the God of Iſrael paſſed through the Eaſterne Gate; Therefore that Gate was ſhut up, and might not be opened any more but to the Prince,</hi> Ezech. 44.2.</p>
                     <p>It is generally confeſſed that the repreſentations there made cannot be taken for any Temple which before was, or which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was to be in <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> alſo that it is to be meant of the <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which is above.</p>

                     <p>But whatſoever the <hi>Viſion</hi> deſcribeth, whether a <hi>Temple</hi> made with, or one made without hands, yet this is plaine, That the Glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſeene to come by the way of the Eaſt.</p>

                     <p>The truth is (how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeeme to be) that <hi>Adam</hi> worſhipped God in Paradiſe toward the Eaſt, and ſo did the whole world till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.</p>

                     <p>But in the <hi>Holy way</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is called <hi>Kedem,</hi> that is, the face or fore-part, the <hi>Weſt Achor,</hi> the backe-part.

                     <p>Indeed <hi>Kedem</hi> properly ſignifieth not the face, but that which is before the face. It is the ſame with <hi>Kibla</hi> in the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick.

                        <hi>Maimon</hi> repeateth there another practiſe of theirs to the ſame purpoſe, but ſuch a one as will uncover too much if it be rendered in our words.</p>
                     <p>But the fitteſt inſtance to this end is from the <hi>Lawes of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58600:66"/> blood.</hi> It is forbidden there that any man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould eate blood.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is commanded that the Blood be ſprinkled upon the Altar, and moreover that it be covered with duſt, or ſprinkled upon the ground as water.</p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did uſe to eate the blood, ſome others who reckoned this to inhumanity, at the killing of a Beaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the blood, and gathered it up into a veſſell or trench, and then ſitting downe in a Circle about the blood they eate up the fleſh, and ſatisfied themſelves with an opinion that their <hi>Daemons</hi> fed upon the blood entertaining a ſtrong conceipt that this manner of ſitting at the ſame Table with their Gods would engage them to a nearer tie of converſation and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and promiſing to themſelves alſo that theſe ſpirits would inſinuate themſelves in dreames and render them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of prophecy and things to come.</p>
                     <p>In reference to theſe <hi>wayes of the Amorites,</hi> God expreſſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his people to eate blood, for ſo ſome of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did; and to meet with others who gathered it up into a Veſſell, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the blood ſhould be ſpilt upon the ground like water.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe they ate their ſacrifices in a Circle round about the blood, He alſo commanded that the Blood ſhould be ſprinkled (not about but) upon the Altar.</p>
                     <p>So here it is forbidden to any man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſeeth a Kid <hi>in the milke of the Damme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is certaine that this muſt reſpect to ſome Idolatrous Rite of the Heathen, for to take any other courſe with it is not to tell the meaning, but to make a ſhift with the place.</p>
                     <p>Here to hope for any ſuch cuſtome to be found of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in groſſe, the labour hath been ſufficiently loſt already.</p>
                     <p>If it were true, as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> ſaid (but did not beleeve himſelf) that the Gentiles uſed to ſacrifice a Kid ſodden in the dammes milke to the God of the fields, it would make very much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the matter. Thus much is ſo, that <hi>Sylvanus</hi> was the God of the woods and fields, and that milke was one of thoſe things which were to him offered in Sacrifice, as a Kid to <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:58600:66"/> Milke alſo was among the Sacrifices of <hi>Pan</hi> the God of the Shepheards, and the ſame was offered to <hi>Cores</hi> in the <hi>Ambarvalia.</hi> There is reaſon alſo why a Goate and Goates milke ſhould be of Reverent importance in the Heathen devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe ſuckt no other milke then this. It is expreſt upon a Reverſe of <hi>Valerian</hi> ſilver. The young God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſhe Goat holding by one of the Hornes, with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Jovi Creſcenti.</hi> Neither is it to be denyed, but that in the ſacrifices of <hi>Bacchus</hi> both a Kid and milke were offered. But of a Kid ſodden in the dammes milke in any Rites of late Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then devotion it reſteth to be revealed as yet.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Simler</hi> noteth, that ſome of the Hebrewes ſay, that the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> uſed to ſeeth a Kid in Milke. 'Tis true indeed <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſaith they doe ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>If they did to the Text here, they are to ſeeth a Kid in Milke, which is more I thinke then the beſt man in the Kitchin will undertake to do, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The firſt words beare a troubleſome ſenſe, and the laſt are ſo plainely Magicall, that of themſelves they prevent any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of interpretatian. Therefore <hi>Abarbinel</hi> made his recourſe thus farre this way, as to thinke that it was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Rite of the Heathen, To ſeeth a Kid in Milke at the time of in-gathering of fruits, hoping by this to propitiate their Gods.</p>
                     <p>And he pretendeth as for a ground of his meaning the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58600:67"/> meſta</hi> a kinde of Country feaſt which their Shepheards uſe to make themſelves merry at twice a yeare with <hi>Kiddes</hi> and <hi>milke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to eate <hi>Kid</hi> or <hi>milke,</hi> or both, is a continuall Nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The very words themſelves inſtantly import a Magicall preparation. Therefore the very learned <hi>Maimon,</hi> though he interpret this place for company as the ordinary Jewes do, yet he doubted not to caſt it upon <hi>the way of the Amorites,</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe he findes it twice annext to the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But it ſeemes the <hi>Karraite</hi> (quoted by Maſter <hi>Cudworth</hi> a learned man of the equall Univerſity) had met with this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Karraite</hi> ſaith, that</p>
                     <p>It was a Cuſtome of the ancient Heathens, at the <hi>In-gathering of their fruits to take a Kid, and ſeeth it in the milke of the Damme, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Note this alſo, that theſe <hi>Zabians</hi> might not make any other but a Magicall uſe of a Kid.<note place="margin">More. N p. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>46.</hi>
                        </note> Theſe <hi>Worſhippers</hi> did ſacrifice to the <hi>Seirim</hi> or Daemons in the forme of Goates; Therefore the eating of Goates fleſh was forbidden them. Notwithſtanding, nay for that reaſon the Magicall uſe of Goates was Holy and religious.</p>
                     <p>The Magicall preparation of a Kid hath a plaine reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Seirim</hi> or Goat-Devills. But for the reaſons of the manner they cannot be given, for then it were not Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
                     <p>'Tis enough that ſuch a thing was uſed in the way of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and therefore expreſſely forbidden to the people of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58600:67"/> God. Alſo it may very well be thought that the People of God themſelves (ſome of them) drew downe this Example of the <hi>Zabii</hi> into their owne practiſe. Why not this as well as ſacrificing to the <hi>Seirim</hi> or <hi>Devill-Goats? Levit.</hi> 17.7. If the people of God did ſo, that is <hi>ſeeth a Kid in the milke of the Damme,</hi> to haſten the maturation of their Fruits, then this was the reaſon why the Prohibition is ſo often repeated in the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maimon</hi> quoteth a like practiſe of the <hi>Zabii</hi> out of their booke <hi>Avoda Henbattith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They purified certaine things</hi> (which the booke nameth) <hi>having obſerved when the Sunne was in this or that degree. They performed ſome Magicall operations, and ſo went away with this perſwaſion, that whoſoever ſhould beſprinkle a new planted Tree with this charme, the Tree would fructifie in a ſhorter time then otherwiſe would have done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This affordeth another likelihood for the <hi>Karraites</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeething a Kid &amp;c. that this alſo was to be found in the <hi>Zabians</hi> bookes, though the learned <hi>Maimon</hi> had not yet met with it.</p>

                     <p>According to the firſt Modell of the Creation the ſtories of this <hi>Great Pile</hi> ſtood not as now they doe. <hi>The Earth was without forme and void, i. e.</hi> (as ſome would have it, But I have told you the meaning of it before) unbecomed with that glorious furniture which now it hath, ſtanding all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with a Globe of waters vaſtly extending, which <hi>the Maker</hi> did, to ſhew that <hi>the Earth was his before he gave it to the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 115.16.</p>
                     <p>Here he might have ſtaid his hand reflecting upon himſelfe this <hi>Mighty Power</hi> which could ſettle ſuch a ponderous maſſe upon it ſelfe. But to ſhew alſo that <hi>He created it not in vaine, but formed it to be inhabited,</hi> Iſay 45.18. <hi>He divided the waters from the waters by a Firmament or Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The waters below this Firmament he commanded to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, which made the <hi>Seas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the dry land appeared.</hi> Not now ſo preciſely globous as before, But recompenced with an extuberancy of Hils and Mountaines for the <hi>Receipts</hi> into which he had ſunk the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In the ſpace above the <hi>Firmament, He laid up the Depth in Store houſes,</hi> Pſal. 33.7. From whence when He <hi>uttered his voice</hi> (as at the Floud) <hi>there was a multitude</hi> (or Noiſe) <hi>of Waters in the Heavens,</hi> Jer. 10.13.</p>
                     <p>And whoſoever ſhall looke back with an unintereſted eye upon that immane, &amp; (if the <hi>Scripture</hi> had not ſaid it) all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Deluge will be farre to ſeeke how ſuch an impoſſible confluence of waters could otherwiſe be aſſembled together.</p>
                     <p>For to lay the charge of this huge effect unto the Starres, or any Conjunction of the Superiour Bodies, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Albumazar</hi> did, is not to releaſe, but entangle the Wonder; For beſides that thoſe <hi>Lights</hi> above are not intruſted with ſo unlimited a power, no not in their ſtrongeſt conſpiracies of

                     <p>A <hi>Conjunction</hi> indeed there was of ♄ and ♃ going before the floud, but looking upon the <hi>effect</hi> at ſuch a diſtance as could be of no conſiderable availe.</p>

                     <p>And to give up that account which the Common People in Philoſophy uſe to doe, that theſe <hi>mighty waters</hi> could be emptyed out of the <hi>bottles of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever or Condenſations of Aire runneth us a ground upon a ridiculous courſe in Nature, or indecent in Miracle; whereas if we betake our ſelves to this other way, one onely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> will ſerve the turne, to force downe the motion of theſe waters by a <hi>high Hand,</hi> which otherwiſe according to <hi>Received Nature</hi> muſt have beene more then 100 yeares in falling.</p>
                     <p>What if it rained 40 Dayes and 40 Nights, had it rained 40 yeares what could this have done towards ſuch a heap of flouds as <hi>prevailed above the higheſt mountaines</hi> 15 <hi>Cubits upwards?</hi> be their perpendicular height taken after the moſt moderate eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>So that in juſtice of reaſon we may conclude, that theſe <hi>Decumani fluctus</hi> could not be raiſed without a ſupply from this <hi>great Abyſſe;</hi> and unleſſe <hi>one depth had called another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe confeſſeth as much, that the <hi>fountaines of the Tehom Rabba or this great Deepe,</hi> or (as the

                     <p>And at the abatement of theſe waters when <hi>God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Noah,</hi> the ſame Fountaines of this <hi>Deepe</hi> are ſaid to have beene ſtopped <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.2. which can admit of no other (but an miraculous) ſenſe; for we cannot underſtand it of any ſubterraneous Abyſſe, without an open defiance to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Therefore betwixt the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Heaven of Heavens</hi> there muſt be a <hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> or <hi>great Deepe,</hi> and for this it is that he is ſaid to have layed the Beames of his <hi>Chambers</hi> in the waters, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 104.3.

                     <p>And he is ſaid to have watered the Hills from theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.13.

                     <p>I am almoſt perſwaded to thinke, that untill <hi>Neahs</hi> time <hi>The Lord God had not cauſed it to raine upon the Earth, but a miſt went up and watered the whole face of the ground. Gen.</hi> 2.5, 6. And a River went forth of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden

                     <p>Here I ſhall need to make you a Note or two as concerning this Prayer. It may poſſibly ſeem ſtrange to you, that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſon ſhould be ſo dayly ſaid before the body of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To take you off from that, you muſt know that it is a moſt confeſt Tradition among the Eaſterne men (and Saint <hi>Ephrem</hi> himſelf is very principall in the Authority) that <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded by God (and left the ſame in charge to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that his dead Body ſhould be kept above ground till a fullneſſe of time ſhould come to commit it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The Prieſt who was to officiate at this Funerall they ſay was <hi>Melchiſedec;</hi> and that he buryed this body at <hi>Salem,</hi> which might very well bee the middle of the habitable world as then, and that it was indeed ſo afterwards, it hath been told you before.</p>
                     <p>Therefore (as they ſay) this body of <hi>Adam</hi> was embalmed and tranſmitted from Father to Son by a Reverend and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious way of conveighance, til at laſt it was delivered up by <hi>Lamech</hi> into the hands of <hi>Noah,</hi> who being well adviſed of that faſhion of the old world, which was to worſhip God toward a certaine place, and conſidering with himſelfe that this could not be towards the Right (which was the Eaſt) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inconſtancy and inconvenience of a Ship, appointed out the middle of the Arke for the <hi>place of Prayer,</hi> and made it as Holy as hee could by the Reverend preſence of <hi>Adams</hi> Body.</p>
                     <p>Towards this place therefore the prayer was ſaid, not as terminating any the leaſt moment of Divine worſhip in the body (it were a ſtupid thing to think ſo) but (where it ought to be, and where all worſhippers doe, or ſhould do ſo) in God himſelf and only him, as the very Tradition diſtinctly cleareth the caſe.<note place="margin">Caten.

                     <p>OF the interruption of the Soules Immortality, betwixt the moment of death (it muſt not now be call'd Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is the inſidious debate of theſe eager dayes. A fitter and more congeneall time to bring this Monſter to the Birth, (though there is not ſtrength to bring forth) was never yet endeavoured to be wreſted out of the hands of Providence, by the greateſt deepneſſe of Satan.</p>
                     <p>The Familiar that converſed ſo much with <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Father told him, That their Spirits and the Devils dye too. 'Twere good believe this alſo.</p>
                     <p>But if the Beaſts and we have all one breath, then why doe not their Spirits too return to God that gave them? If Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption have put Corruption on, we may very well eate and drinke as we doe, for to morrow we dye indeed.</p>
                     <p>The unlikely Heathen ploughed in more hope then ſo. In Hieroglyphicall learning, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſet downe the <hi>Axis</hi> of a <hi>Pyramis</hi> for the Soule, and therefore the Figure of their Sepulchers was Pyramidall. The myſtery is Geometricall, that as by the converſion or turning about of a Pyramid upon his Axis, the axis remaining ſtil the ſame, there is a Mathematical creation of a new ſolid or Cone, ſo by the Revolution of a certaine time of yeares about the ſoule (the ſoule continuing ſtill the ſame in a conſtant courſe of immortality) a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall ariſe and reunite again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſtin. Steuch Eugubin.</note>Indeed he that will turn over the Bookes, <hi>De perenni Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophia,</hi> will finde that theſe Heathens did beleeve not onely this, but the greateſt part of our Divinity more then we our ſelves doe.</p>
                     <p>I am induced to beleeve that without any further ſubtilty or arrogancy of diſpute, there is an invincible argument for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58600:79"/> the thing ſecretly imprinted in the Inſtinct and Conſcience of the Soul it ſelf, becauſe it is every good mans hope that it ſhall be ſo, and every wicked mans feare that it will. And that at leaſt a parcell judgment may preſently be pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>wandring Soule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However the opportunity of this part of Scripture doth not ſo directly call upon me to any ſuch kinde of Controverſie. Indeed I would be taken to be ſo ſecure of the Souls Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that I am going about to leave the Body it ſelfe in a very fair Condition of Incorruption. And I ſee not but that it may very well ſuit with the Immoderations of the time to advance up the immortality of the Body, when men have ſo little to doe as to raiſe ſuſpicions upon that of the Soule.</p>
                     <p>The Jewes commonly expreſſe Reſurrection by Regermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or growing up again like a Plant. So they doe in that ſtrange tradition of theirs, of the <hi>Luz</hi> an immortal little bone in the bottome of the <hi>Spina dorſi;</hi> which though our Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are bound to deride as a kinde of <hi>Terra incognita</hi> in the Leſſer world, yet theirs, (who know the Bones too, but by Tradition) will tell ye that there it is, and it was created by God in an unalterable ſtate of incorruption, that it is of a ſlippery condition and maketh the Body but beleeve that it groweth up with, or receiveth any nouriſhment from that. Whereas indeed the <hi>Luz</hi> is every wayes immortally diſpos'd, and out of whoſe everliving <hi>Power</hi> fermented by a kinde of dew from Heaven, all the dry Bones ſhall be reunited and knit together, and the whole Generation of mankinde recruite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>There is a better temper and holding a more lawfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency in that Rite of theirs, which of old they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſtill doe at their Funerall Celebrations.</p>
                     <p>It is thus taken notice of by their late <hi>Rabbine Leo Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena, Nel ritorno dalla foſſa, ogn' uno ſpianta dell' herba dalla terra, due o tre volte, e ſe la getta dietro dicendo quelle parole del Salmo, eſpuntarano dalla citta come l'herba della terra, per ſegno della reſurrectione.</hi> That is, As they returne backe from the Grave, every one of them plucketh up the Graſſe from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58600:80"/> ground twice or three times, and throweth it behind him, ſaying thoſe words of the Pſalme, <hi>(they ſhall flouriſh out of the City like the graſſe of the Earth)</hi> in token of the Reſurrection, &amp;c. <hi>De gli riti Hebraici di queſti tempi Part.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>In ſome places they ſay theſe very words of the Prophet here, <hi>Your Bones, &amp;c.</hi> The Rite is very proper, as to ſhew that the dead are not quite pluckt up, but only cut down like a flower, which at the returne of time reinforcing from its root and ſtock, ſpringeth up again.</p>
                     <p>But if our Bones are to flouriſh like an Hearbe, wee have a ſurer word of experience from the Fact. If a vegetable can be call'd up out of its aſhes, there is a ſtronger pretence to our urnes.</p>
                     <p>The Grounds of Chimicall Philoſophy goe thus.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are the principles into which all things doe reſolve. And that the Radicall and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall moiſture whereby the firſt principall of <hi>Salt</hi> conſiſteth, cannot be conſumed by <hi>Calcination,</hi> but the forcible tinctures and impreſſions of things, as Colour, Taft, Smell, nay and the very formes themſelves are inviſibly kept in ſtore in this firm and vitall principle.</p>
                     <p>To make this good by the Experiment, they take a Roſe, Gillyflower, or any kinde of Plant whatſoever. They take this Simple in the Spring time, in its fulleſt and moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſiſtence. They beate the whole Plant in a Mortar, Rootes, Stalkes, Flowers, Leaves and all, till it be reduced to a confuſed Maſſe. Then after <hi>Maceration, Fermentation, Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and other workings of Art, there is extracted a kinde of Aſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When you would ſee any of theſe Vegetables againe, they apply a Candle or ſoft Fire to the Glaſſe, and you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

The wonder of this is farre above that of the Reſurrection of our bodies, for then the Earth giveth up her dead but one for one, but in the caſe of the Corne ſhee giveth up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living ones for one dead one. O the intolerable madneſſe of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving men!

                     <p>Here (though the opportunity ſeemes to be very fairly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd) I avoid to gaine any reputation towards the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Bodies from that parcell Riſing of Legges and Armes, &amp;c. which uſeth to be ſeene and beleeved at a place in <hi>Aegypt</hi> not farre from <hi>Gran Cairo,</hi> upon Good Friday and the Eve of that.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed (if the thing it ſelfe be ſo) that in this caſe too our Bones doe flouriſh like an hearb, for thoſe little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections are not ſeen to riſe, but riſen.</p>
                     <p>And ſo like Lims of Immortality they ſpring up from the Earth, as they did from that other <hi>Deadneſſe</hi> of their Mothers wombe.</p>
                     <p>Wee our ſelves grow thus up too like the Graſſe of the Field; we are not ſeen but found to doe ſo.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſo with theſe <hi>fore-running parts.</hi> If you draw neare to touch a head or a legge, you ſhall perceive no more of this Reſurrection for that time, but if you give backe, and leave the <hi>Miracle</hi> to it ſelfe, you ſhall preſently finde it more a man at your returne.</p>

                     <p>That which ſeemeth to bee wanting to the authority of this ſtrange thing is, that there ſhould be no ordinary memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (none at all I can meete with yet) of the matter in any of their owne Bookes. That in the Greeke Liturgies out of the Leſſon for the time, I know not how to make reckoning of, as enough to this purpoſe, in any other Bookes of theirs, and ſome likely ones too, I meet not with any notice at all. And yet as to that I can retort this anſwer upon my ſelfe, that a thing of ſo cheape and common beleefe amongſt them could not fitly be expected to bee written out as a rarity by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſent forth into theſe unbeleeving Corners of the World: Which though it may paſſe for a reaſon why there ſhould not be any ſuch common report of the thing, yet lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me ſcope to think, that there is ſome ſpeciall mention of it in the Arabick or Coptick Hiſtories, which when it ſhall be met with if it be found to referre up the Wonder to ſome excellent and important Originall, it will the better defend this matter of Fact, from the opinion of impoſture.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the riſing of theſe armes and legs otherwiſe is but an ill argument to be uſed for the Reſurrection of our bodies, for 'tis eaſier to beleeve this, then that.</p>

                     <p>By <hi>preſence, power,</hi> and <hi>eſſence,</hi> the Doctours generally mean; by the firſt, an appropinquity of Viſion that all things are open and naked unto his ſight; by the ſecond, an Approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of power, that He worketh in, and ruleth over <hi>All;</hi> by the third, an Indiſtance of his <hi>Being</hi> to all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of <hi>Actuall</hi> or <hi>poſſible</hi> exiſtence.</p>

                     <p>Relating to this firſt Reſpect of <hi>Preſence, Power,</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> we ſay that God equally diſpoſeth of himſelfe to all things and men, and that he cannot thus be more in one place then another.</p>
                     <p>But the Reſpect of Grace and Spirit ſuper induceth a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all influence and Immediation of bleſſings, and imprinting the <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> whatſoever with a much more intimate and more excellent Relation. Thus God is ſaid to be nearer to this man then to that, more in one place then in another. Thus he is ſaid to depart from ſome &amp; come to others, to leave this place &amp; to abide in that, not by Eſſentiall application of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

With juſt men, faith he, God is preſent, <hi>in veritate,</hi> In deed, but with the wicked, diſſemblingly, ('tis the Fathers expreſſion) <hi>in diſſimulatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As he is to all and in all places, he is called in the Holy Tongue, <hi>Jehovah, He</hi> that is, or Eſſence; but as he uſeth to be in Holy places he is called <hi>Shecinah,</hi> that is, He that dwelleth or <hi>preſence.</hi>

                     <p>In regard unto this great and glorious preſence, I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to reflect upon two principall inconſiderations. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of ſome, and the irreverence of almoſt <hi>All.</hi> The firſt is theirs who preferre the <hi>Barne</hi> before the <hi>Church,</hi> as if God would be more at home in their out-houſes then in his own dwelling Manſion. Hee heareth indeed whatſoever prayers, whereſoever made, but his eares are ſaid to bee arrect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58600:88"/> only to thoſe that are made in this place. I know that our Father is to be prayed to in ſecret, but that is that hee is not to be prayed to in the <hi>corners of the ſtreets,</hi> that is, thoſe ends and corners of the ſtreets where the Gates are, as the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopick</hi> very well rendereth. For the Eaſtern faſhion is to have a Gate almoſt to every ſtreet, ſo that theſe Corners of the ſtreets were eminently open and the fitteſt places that could be choſen for one to pray in, that did it therefore that <hi>hee might bee ſeen of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was heard upon his bed, but his prayer, what was it, but that he might goe once more to Church? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5. And even then though in that extremity, he could not goe up into the houſe of the Lord; yet at leaſt hee turned himſelfe in his Chamber that way, ſupplying what he could not doe by bodily remotion with holy <hi>Extaſie</hi> and tranſportation of minde.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt fault is committed by thoſe that come, for as we demeane our ſelves, 'twere much better for us not to be there, or if wee be, that God himſelfe were away.

                     </p>
                     <p>And what would you have theſe Heathens to bee? ſome of their owne Prophets have ſaid, that <hi>God is the Center of all things, eſpecially of of all men.</hi> And as the reſpect is from the <hi>univerſall merit</hi> of Chriſt. I am ſure the lines are all drawne equall, and the difference will be only in the application and tendency to this point. The Chriſtian accompts (and juſtly too) that he moves thither by a ſtronger and more proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and yet ſome have entertained ſo good an opinion of the Heathens morality and good courſe of life, that they thinke their caſe to bee not much unlike that experiment in

                     <p>But what have I to doe with another mans ſervant? The worſt you can ſay by theſe men, is, that they have not the knowledge of Chriſt, but we ſay we know him, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves againe, by doing the workes of our father the Devill. They are blinde indeed, but our caſe is worſe, for wee ſay we ſee. And which doe you think is better, not to know Chriſt; then to have no Cloke for denying him?</p>
                     <p>You know who ſaid it, that the Chriſtian Religion had beene the cauſe of all the diſtractions in theſe parts of the World; I am ſure it hath beene the pretence, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by private intereſt, and crooked to ingagements of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones particular, wee may find in all other States as wee now feels in our owne.</p>
                     <p>As we make it, Religion is indeed but a politique engine of State, as uſefull for the battery as defence, and as equally tractable to the Ruine as to the conſervation of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> neceſſary to the turning of affaires here below, but of no concernment to the other world.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58600:94"/> to weepe, but never once to laugh, much leſſe, that <hi>Saturne</hi> with <hi>Venus</hi> could make him to have a mole in his Face.

                     <p>But ſtill I doe but hold you in hand.</p>
                     <p>That which I may lawfully and innocently obſerve in the <hi>Scheme</hi> of our Lords Nativity concerneth thus.</p>

                        </gap> of Righteouſneſſe was very fitly borne in <hi>Libra,</hi> the ſigne and Conſtellation of Juſtice. Next to this the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers <hi>Horoſcope</hi> was quite contrary to that of the World. The Aſcendent of the Creation was <hi>Aries,</hi> for the World was created in the Spring, as to the poſition of <hi>Iudea.</hi> I cannot ſtay to prove it here, I have done it elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>But much above all this there fell out at this time a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction (the greateſt that can be) of the 8 and 9 Spheares in the Head of <hi>Aries.</hi> From whence it will follow that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the beginning of this world the <hi>Aſteriſmes</hi> were all out of their proper places, (it pleaſed God to have it ſo) now at the <hi>reſtitution</hi> of the world, they were all found in their owne diviſions.

                     <p>The period according to ſome is to finiſh a Circle of 30, if not 40 thouſand yeares.</p>
                     <p>This great year began at our Saviours Nativity, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to expect that it ſhould ever have an end, as to us and this World, cannot be thought of, but upon grounded Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme and abſurdity.</p>
                     <p>I have onely one thing here to confeſſe, that this figure of our Saviours Nativity is erected according to the <hi>Dionyſian</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:58600:94"/> rate of account, which uſeth to be called <hi>Vulgare initium anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Domini. The vulgar Epoche of the yeares of Chriſt,</hi> but demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to bee falſe (as they themſelves doubt not) by <hi>Mercator, Chriſtmannus, Ioſeph Scaliger, Sethus Calviſius, Suſlyga</hi> the <hi>Polonian,</hi> and others, Maſters all in Mathematicall Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; ſome of them demonſtrate that this <hi>Aera</hi> is falſe by one year, ſome by two, others by three, the <hi>Polonian</hi> by four, and ſome others by five. But when I ſaw that there could bee ſo many <hi>true Accompts,</hi> I thought it beſt to ſit down and abide by <hi>the old falſe one,</hi> as well in reverence to the Tradition of the Church, as for the rare appearances in the Scheme it ſelf, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of their own ſtrength to evidence, that this was the time both for the year and day, though reaſon and Tradition ſhould pretend againſt it.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe there be ſome (and ſome too that know not why they do it neither) who continue to call in queſtion the Antiquity and truth of this day, I will put in a little more weight into their ſcale who have very well aſſured this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter already both by <hi>hiſtoricall</hi> tradition and <hi>Mathematicall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>

                     <p>
                        <q>The holy men of old ſaid, Remit and forgive unto all men whatſoever they have done againſt me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And leade us not into Temptation, but deliver us from the evill thing. For thine is the Kingdome, and thou ſhalt reign in Glory (or power) for ever and for evermore.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore there is the ſame reaſon for the <hi>Clauſe</hi> as for the whole Prayer, and the reaſon as from hence is very full and following.</p>
                     <p>You finde ſuch a kinde of Doxology at the end of <hi>Noah's</hi> Prayer, and you will generally meet with ſome ſuch thing in the Common formes of Eaſterne Devotion.</p>

                     <p>It is moſt commonly beleeved that this Hymne was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Councell of Nice.</hi> The Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it is more ancient then ſo; and that from the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> times it was appointed by the Apoſtles themſelves to be ſung by the new converts in Baptiſme; and Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſeems to him to ſay as much; but it is to be preſumed that this Hymne was not ancienter then the cauſe of it, and that was the <hi>Arian</hi> blaſphemy; though otherwiſe it is moſt true that the Antiquity thereof is to be fetcht out of the ancient forme of Baptiſme, ſo farre the Cardinall was right. I goe about to make up what is wanting on his part.</p>
                     <p>The forme of Baptiſme ſet downe by our Lord himſelfe, was, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                     <p>In the Greek Services we meet it very often, and no leſſe then 6 or 7 times in their Order of Baptiſme; the Church it

                     <p>Therefore the <hi>firſt matter</hi> of the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> were the words of our Saviour <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And becauſe at the uttering of theſe words the Prieſt and the <hi>N:</hi> were to ſtand up and turne themſelves towards the Eaſt, therefore alſo the Hymne it ſelfe was to be ſaid or ſung the ſame way. And ſo we obſerve it. In the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (our owne I meane) we ſeeme a little to tranſgreſſe, for no man riſeth up to that <hi>Gloria Patri;</hi> but we are to conſider that this verſe was there inſerted, when the Letany was, what it is now, but called, <hi>Proceſſion, a procedendo,</hi> and then it was no exception.</p>

When wee ſaie that they all agree (if it muſt needs hee) wee except <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> but why ſhould wee ſo do, ſeeing that his thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſix <hi>Cels,</hi> if they were doubled, (as hee ſaith that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) are as manie in number as the ſeventie two of the reſt are? If they were not, it leſſeneth but the number of the <hi>Cels;</hi> taketh little awaie from the Miracle of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: or if it did, yet the ſingle teſtimonie of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> will not bee ſeen through ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>But beſides our Autoritie from the Antients, wee may gain ſom probabilitie toward the credit of the <hi>Cels,</hi> if it bee enquired into the Cauſſes which ought to move the King to reſolv upon ſuch a waie for the Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>Two Reaſons eſpecially may bee urged for this: the one whereof eſpecially concern's the purpoſe of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and both of them the King's Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>For the Purpoſe of God in the Tranſlation, it was one of thoſe things which might bee required for the coming in of the Gentiles, that the Scripture ſhould bee provided before hand, in ſuch a Language as would bee moſt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58600:126"/> known at the Primitive times; therefore it was neceſſarie that all religious care ſhould bee had of the Tranſlation, and that it ſhould bee ſafely laid up and reſerved for the time appointed: And that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> might ſee to this, it was needful that they ſhould bee prepoſſeſt with a ſtrong Conceit of the Divinitie of this Law: and this could not bee more conveniently don, then by ſuch a miraculous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the Interpretation: For otherwiſe, why ſhould <hi>Ptolomie</hi> think more divinely of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then of his own? ſeeing that all waies of Religion would ſeem ſtrange, but that wee are taught betimes to fear: and till wee receiv a Spirit of Judgment to diſcern the Right waie, everie waie is thought to bee wrong; but that which wee are brought up in. And why ſhould <hi>Ptolomie</hi> have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then of his <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſt?</hi> who as hee is accounted by ſom to have gon before this <hi>Moſes</hi> in time, ſo by others hee is thought not to have com far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him in worth and excellencie. But what could <hi>Moſes</hi> teach to them, who had all his learning from thence? for hee was brought up a Scholar in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And what would bee thought of theſe Scriptures, when the King ſhould hear it read in <hi>Oſee,</hi> that God commanded a Prophet to commit Adulterie? and in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that hee taught his own People how to Cozen the <hi>Egyptians?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Solomon: as the Wiſe man dieth ſo dieth the Fool,</hi> how would it ſtand with their Doctrine of the Tranſmigration of Souls? according to which, the Soul of a Wiſe man ought to paſs into ſuch an one; and the ſoul of a Fool, into an Aſs.</p>
                  <p>For the Reſurrection of the Bodie, ſmall comfort was to bee had from the drie bones in the vallie of <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian</hi> had better hopes then theſe, for hee had his dead Bodies ſtill to ſhew; and ſuch as had gotten by their Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, for they were everie daie leſs ſubject to Corruption then before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, That there was no God like the God of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Could the King believ that, when hee ſhould finde in theſe Scriptures that even this God alſo had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58600:126"/> a <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and a <hi>Son?</hi> or if hee had been ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thoſe of the Heathen, was it likely that <hi>Aaron</hi> his own high Prieſt would have preferred their <hi>Apis,</hi> or the Calf of <hi>Egypt</hi> before him?</p>
                  <p>when theſe things ſhould com to bee conſidered by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified diſcretion of the Heathen, how could they chuſe but appear far beſide, and below their own Majeſtie? for ſuch untoward Notions as theſe muſt ſeem to bee, could never argue to him that perfection and tranſcendencie of Style and Matter, which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had pretended: therefore that the King might bee brought on to a reverend eſtimation of thoſe things, it was much to the purpoſe that hee ſhould bee thus prepared by a wonder: for it greatly concern'd the ſafetie of the Tranſlation, that it ſhould bee firſt eſteemed by the King: for otherwiſe, Principles ſo averſ from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> manner of Devotion, had never been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie at all, or not long in the Librarie at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> becauſ, even the opinion of a new waie in Religion, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſper without a Precedent, and ſuch an one as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception; and though it bee never ſo wiſely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, yet it ſeldom gaineth reputation from leſſer exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then that of a King: And it ſeemeth, by that wee finde in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> that the Miracle wrought the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame effect in <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> as wee would have it, for hee ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>that the King perceiving that theſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Men had all agreed, not onely in the matter, but alſo in the Manner of their Interpretation, inſomuch that no man differed from another not in a word; but everie man expreſsed the ſame conceit, and by the ſame phraſe: hee ſtood amazed, and nothing doubting, but that the Interpretation was wrought by Divine Power; hee acknowledged that the Interpreters were worthie of all honor, as beeing Men to whom God did bear a peculiar reſpect: and having first given them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58600:127"/> condign reward, hee took order for their departure into their own Countrie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame effect which the wonder wrought upon the Prince, it wrought alſo upon the People; for ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which is alreadie obſerved out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee that the purpoſe of God in the Tranſlation would not onely endure, but did alſo varie conveniently require, that ſomthing in the Buſineſs ſhould bee miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for the King's better inſtruction, and that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures might have ſo much honor and admiration, as might gain them ſomthing in the Opinion of the Heathen, and preſerv them from the Injuries of Time.</p>
                  <p>And this was to bee the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon, for which the King ought to take ſuch a waie for the Tranſlation, is, For that hee made que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of their Fidelitie.</p>
                  <p>And that this may bee accepted for a ſufficient Cauſ, it ſhall bee ſet down, That the King's miſtruſt was raiſed upon ſuch ſurmiſes as were no way frivolous, but contained in them matter of moment.</p>
                  <p>For it could not bee exſpected from anie Nation in thoſe daies, that they ſhould bee truſtie in revealing the Secrets of their Religion; but from the <hi>Jews</hi> it would bee thought impoſſible: for this Nation ſtood ſo nicely affected to their <hi>Sepher Hattocah,</hi> or Book of the Law, that even in the ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Circumſtances, it was obſerved with an incredible Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie of Devotion.</p>

                  <p>To let paſs other Circumſtances, which would make this manifeſt, wee have need onely of that one which moſt of all concerneth our matter in hand.

                  <p>Thus ſaith <hi>Armius</hi> the Chronologer. <hi>In the nineteenth year of the Reign of</hi> Ptolomie <hi>the ſon of</hi> Ptolomie, <hi>the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould gather together the Seniors of the children of</hi> Iſraël, <hi>and that they ſhould bring with them the <gap reason="foreign">

And the Seniors came and preſented themſelvs together with their moſt divine Book of the Law. And the King's command was, that everie man ſhould tranſlate the whole Book. And it came to paſs that the Seniors diſagreed in their Interpretation: and the King commanded to put them in Priſon, and in Chains, &amp;c.</hi> Thus wee ſee that the King was led by good Reaſon to a ſuſpicion of his Interpreters, and that therefore in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie hee would take ſuch a courſ for his Tranſlation, as wee have alreadie made report of, According to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Antients.</p>
                  <p>But nothing ever lighted ſo heavie upon this matter of the <hi>Cels</hi> as the Autoritie of S. <hi>Heirom,</hi> which was the more likely to oppreſs it, by reaſon of his great learning and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral repute; becauſ a Teſtimonie, for the moſt part, is not meaſured by its own validitie, but the Autor's worth; and wee do not uſually obſerv what force it may have in it ſelf, but from whence it came.</p>

                  <p>True it is, than S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in Learning and Knowledg could not bee inferior to anie of his time; and therefore beeing a great Scholar, hee might the eaſilier fall into that common infirmitie of thoſe that know much, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to raiſ his own Reputation by the ruine of another Man's. If the Father were thus inclin'd, hee could not bee without ſo much of a Critick, as would teach him to Cenſure; which things while wee do, our Ambition ſeeking for its own ſafetie, alwaies aimeth at thoſe that are fartheſt off, and leaſt able to help themſelvs. Therefore the Antients, and thoſe that are dead, are more eaſily reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the lateſt and the living.

                  <p>Hee that could ſaie of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee was an ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Scholar, 'twas no marvail that hee Cenſur'd <hi>Lactantius,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Hilarie</hi> and <hi>Didymus;</hi> and yet if theſe alſo could not eſcape his reprehenſion, I ſhould not willingly truſt him with <hi>Ariſtaeas;</hi> nor our Hiſtorie of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>

                  <p>But let it bee ſuppoſed, that this learned Father could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern above all this, yet his Teſtimonie could not bee taken for this matter, becauſ wee finde it guiltie of partialitie.</p>
                  <p>For wee are to bee adviſed that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> having gotten a competent knowledg in the Hebrew tongue, by great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and converſation with the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tutor <hi>Barabbas,</hi> undertook a new Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> according to the Original.</p>

This wee are ſure of, becauſ it may bee diſcovered by the Father's own Complaint againſt the Men of his Time. See the Prologue to his Hebrew Tradition upon <hi>Geneſis.</hi>

                  <p>The purpoſe of S. <hi>Heirom</hi> in this, though wee grant it to bee good, yet wee cannot think but the Project was bad: and therefore the Father herein is altogether forſaken by his great friend S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> who on the other ſide laboreth ſo much the more to ſet up the old Reputation of the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, which hee hath not ſpared to do in the moſt prevailing waies, though hee lived at the ſame time with S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and was well acquainted with his Tenets, and loved anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the better for beeing his. <hi>Auſtin</hi> therefore in his 8 Epiſtle to S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaking of the Septuagint, thus hee profeſſeth, <hi>De quorum vel conſilii, vel ſpiritûs majori concordia, quàm ſi unus homo eſſet, non audeo in aliquam partem certam ferre ſententiam, niſi quòd eis praeeminentem Autoritatem in hoc munere ſine Controverſia tribuendam exiſtimo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Commentarie upon the 87 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> hee ſaith, their Autoritie is ſuch, <hi>ut non immeritò propter mirabilem conſenſum, divino Spiritu interpretati eſſe credantur, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had put off this paſſage of the <hi>Cels</hi> with a <hi>Neſcio quo Autore,</hi> as if the Autors of it had been aſhamed to ſhew themſelvs, <hi>Auſtin</hi> is not afraid to ſaie, that thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this were <hi>multi, &amp; non indigni fide;</hi> manie, and worthie to bee believed: And if it bee ſo (ſaith hee) that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation was made by ſeveral Men, in ſeveral <hi>Cels,</hi> and yet no man diſcorded either in ſenſ or words; <hi>Quis huic autoritati</hi> (where hee directly aimeth at S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) <hi>conferre aliquid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum praeferre audeat?</hi> who is hee that ſhall dare, I will not ſaie to prefer anie thing above, but to confer anie thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Autoritie of this Tranſlation.</p>

                     </note> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that there is no reaſon why wee ſhould think otherwiſe of theſe, then wee do of that harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious diſcord which is found to bee among the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; for as there the ſame-Spirit guided each Man's Pen to mean, and yet not write the ſame; ſo here the ſame inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had formerly inſtructed the Original Writers, did now alſo direct the Tranſlators to ſet down the verie ſame things, but in a different waie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in whatſoever the Autoritie of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> could prevail againſt our Storie, it may bee overborn by that which hath been ſaid, moſt of all by the ponderous Teſtimonie of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee com now to Conſider of his Reaſons; the later whereof bearing no notable force in it ſelf, may bee paſſed by, but the former ſtandeth thus.</p>
                  <p>That there could bee no ſuch miraculous Circumſtance in the Tranſlation, as this paſſage of the <hi>Cels,</hi> becauſ then <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> who undertook a particular Narration of this whole Matter, would not have omitted this, if hee had known it; and hee could not chuſe but know it, if it had been don, for hee lived at the ſame time, and the Reaſon prevaileth yet further, becauſ <hi>Joſephus,</hi> relating this Hiſtorie out of <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> maketh no mention of anie ſuch Matter.</p>
                  <p>This Reaſon I was alwaies affraid off: for beſides that it is the ſtronger for beeing given by S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> it hath alſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58600:132"/> ſuch a proper validitie in it ſelf, that if wee ſhould not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decline it, it would injure the probabilitie of all.</p>
                  <p>But the inconvenience that may ariſe by this Reaſon wee ſufficiently avoid, if theſe three things can bee brought to paſs. 1. That the Hiſtorie of the Septuagint which now goeth abroad under the name of <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> is not the intire work of that <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> who lived in the daies of <hi>Ptolemie.</hi> 2. That the true <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi> had this paſſage of the <hi>Cels.</hi> 3. That <hi>Joſephus</hi> left it out, and the Reaſons why.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, which concerneth <hi>Aristaeas,</hi> That hee is to bee taken for a ſpurious Autor, wee are already prevented by the learned <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ives à Caſtro, Scaliger, Voſſius,</hi> and others, who have all ſet down their judgments againſt this Autor. and thoſe that have ſpoken moſt moderately, have ſaid (that which is the verie truth indeed) That the Compiler of this work was much later then the daies of the Tranſlation, and that the Storie as now it is, was gathered together out of <hi>Joſephus, Euſebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and ſom others, which are not now at all, or not yet extant.</p>
                  <p>But becauſ the Credit of anie Autor, eſpecially thoſe that are Antient ought not to bee diſparaged upon a ſlight or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous ground, the Cauſſes ſhall bee ſet down which have neceſſarily moved hereunto.</p>
                  <p>The principal Reaſon rendred by <hi>Vives</hi> and the reſt, is, For that ſom things are cited by the fathers out of <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> which are not to bee found in the Storie as now it ſtand's: Inſtance is made in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> concerning the <hi>Cels,</hi> and in the Letters which paſs'd between <hi>Ptolemie</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, which are not delivered by the Fathers, as they lie in the Storie; but have a manifeſt varietie, and ſuch as cannot eaſily bee reconciled. This Reaſon is good, and maketh much againſt the Compiler, who would bee called by the Name of <hi>Ariſtaeas.</hi> But ſomthing ſhall bee added out of our own Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>The Autor of the Preſent Hiſtorie ſaith, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> going along with the Seniors to the Iſle <hi>Pharos,</hi> went over <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58600:133"/> taken out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who though hee undertake to ſet down the Storie according to <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> yet hee doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, through the whole file of his Narration; but oft-times, and eſpecially where hee would bee brief, hee taketh his own waies of expreſſion; Therefore when hee cometh to tell how the Seniors were conducted by <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> from the Citie to the Iſle, hee delivereth it under the Circumſtances of his own time, as if they had paſſed over the <hi>Heptaſtadium</hi> and the Bridg, becauſ that indeed was the waie in his daies, and as hee thought in the daies of <hi>Ariſtaeas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if our information bee rightly given, wee ſhall finde this to bee a notorious <hi>Anachroniſm:</hi> for at the daies of the Tranſlation <hi>Pharos</hi> was an Iſle, and therefore they could not paſs over thither by Land.</p>

                     <hi>Justin</hi> hath ſaid much for <hi>Alexander</hi> out of <hi>Trogus Pompey,</hi> and much is ſet down by <hi>Diodorus;</hi> to ſaie nothing of <hi>Zeno Demetrius,</hi> printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in vulgar Greek; and a French Autor not extant, both which have written the life of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> and that they might lie by Autoritie, they have don it in verſ: and yet none of all theſe ever durſt to ſaie, that this was anie of his Acts, to join <hi>Pharos</hi> to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> nay <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of this <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Pharos</hi> was an Iſle in thoſe daies, and verie well intimateth, that the Iſthmus was congeſted in after times. Therefore if this would not bee remembred, neither by thoſe who knew all that <hi>Alexander</hi> did, nor yet by others who durſt to write more then they knew: <hi>Bar-Jonah</hi> is not to bee regarded in this matter.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> troubleth us further, for hee ſaith, that this Iſthmus was raiſed <hi>per Superiores Ptolemaeos,</hi> by the former <hi>Ptolemies:</hi> and his Autoritie for this is out of <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> in the third book of his Commentaries <hi>De Bello Civili,</hi> towards the later end of that Book, there <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſaith thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haec inſula objecta Alexandriae portum efficit: ſed â ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus regionibus in longitudinem paſſuum</hi> 900. <hi>in mare jactis

                  <p>At the firſt reading of theſe words, I marvailed how <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> could pick out the thing which is pretended, ſeeing that here is no intimation to that purpoſe; but upon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquirie, I found in the Critical Notes upon this Place, that <hi>Brodaeus</hi> would have it read, <hi>A ſuperioribus Regibus,</hi> and out of this <hi>varia lectio, Scaliger</hi> got his <hi>Superiores Ptolemaeos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe wee then that the true waie of reading ſhould bee according to <hi>Brodaeus,</hi> yet how will <hi>Ceſar</hi> bee truſted for this, in whoſe judgment wee all know that the Pailing up of an Iſthmus would bee too great a work for a woman; in compariſon whereof <hi>Ceſar's</hi> Ditches and Trenches could bear no reputation? Therefore it concern'd the Dictator to darken the glorie of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for fear that ſhould eclipſ his own: therefore the exploit is obſcurely ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in terms of generalitie and ambiguitie, that it was don <hi>A ſuperioribus Regibus,</hi> which whether it bee to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Ptolemie Lagus,</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> or of thoſe which ſucceeded, who can tell us; and if it bee not, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt us.

So wee ſee, that theſe words of <hi>Ceſar</hi> are not of force enough to overthrow the Teſtimonie of <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus:</hi> therefore it holdeth ſtill that <hi>Pharos</hi> remained an <hi>Iſle</hi> till the daies of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and wee are ſure that <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi> was dead long before: therefore for him to make mention of the <hi>Heptaſtadium</hi> is an inexcuſable <hi>Anachroniſm:</hi> and there needeth nothing more to prove the firſt thing which was required, That the Autor of the preſent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Seventie, cannot bee that <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi> who was to live in the daies of <hi>Ptolemie.</hi> Now wee are to prove that the true <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi> had this paſſage of the <hi>Cels.</hi> And this will bee eaſie

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> having had good experience of the Heathen, not onely by his converſation with their Books, but alſo with themſelvs, made obſervation of that, whereof hee himſelf afterward found cauſ to complain: that as they made little account of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Religion; ſo they ſlighted their Antiquities, and misbelieved anie thing that could bee ſaid or written for their Renown. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> beeing well aware of this, and deſirous by all means that his work might finde Acceptation with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> took diligent heed to make the diſpoſition of his Hiſtorie of ſuch a temper, as that nothing ſhould bee propoſed ſo incredible, as not to bear ſom congruitie with ſuch things, which had been known to bee before, and were like to bee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when hee cometh to the miraculous paſſages of Holie Writ, hee uſeth a fair waie of Diſſimulation, ſtill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating the wonder of a work, that hee may bring it down to the Heathens Faith, and make it fit for ordinarie belief.</p>

                  <p>The Reader ſhall willingly believ this, after experience made in an Inſtance or two.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Joſephus</hi> cometh to tell of Iſraëls departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and how they paſſed through the mid'ſt of the Sea upon drie land; hee relateth the Storie <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> but withall ſuperaddeth thereunto a moſt unwarrantable Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation. His fear was, leſt the Gentiles would think much to believ, that the unrulie waves of the Sea ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtaie, but alſo give back at the ſhaking of a Rod, and the voice of a Man. And this would bee the rather doubted of by the Heathen, becauſ notice had been alreadie given unto them by <hi>Artapan,</hi> that howſoever the <hi>Heliopolites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> reported concerning this matter, not much otherwiſe then <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had don; yet the Tradition of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites</hi> was, <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore the Shadow is gon back in the Horizon, from the Point M to Q nearer to the Meridian. Again, the Sun moving from P to R, ſhall bee again in the Vertical F R I S; and the Shadow of the Style ſhall cut the Horizon in S, and the diſtance thereof from the Meridian ſhall bee the Arch A S, as before when the Sun was in F, the point of his riſing.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58600:139"/> Therefore the Shadow is gon back alſo from M by Q to S. Therefore in anie part of the Torrid Zone, where the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Pole is leſs then the Declination of the Sun, the Shadow of a Style perpendicularly erected upon a Plane, may have a natural viſible Retroceſſion, which was required to bee don.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter Novius,</hi> however hee acknowledgeth that the Retrogradation of the Shadow is according to nature in the Caſe propoſed, yet in the Matter of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth it to bee miraculous; and hee maketh the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to conſiſt in this, That it was not don as the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requireth, within, but without the Tropicks, between that of Cancer and the Arctick Circle, for in ſuch a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sphear, the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> was plac'd.</p>
                  <p>But learned <hi>Clavius</hi> (whoſe waie of demonſtration wee follow) maketh it plainly to appear, that the ſame thing may bee don as well in the one Place as the other: And it muſt needs bee ſo, for in our own Elevation, here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (which lieth in the ſame Poſition of Sphear, though not under the ſame Latitude with theirs at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) a Plane may bee fitted for ſuch a Polar Altitude as ſhall bee leſs then twentie three degrees and an half, and then it will have the ſame ſite in reſpect of the Sun, as if it were plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropicks, and ſo the Retroceſſion of the Shadow muſt bee as natural as before.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it muſt bee ſaid againſt <hi>Peter Novius</hi> that the Miracle was not in the going back of the Shadow onely, but the Sun: for ſo it is ſet down by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it was ſet down in the begining that the moſt viſible part of the Miracle was the Retroceſſion of the Shadow: that ſhall here bee proved, becauſ to the ſtrength of our Obſervation it is required that this ſhould bee.</p>
                  <p>The moſt received opinion concerning the Degree in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> is, That they ſhould bee meant of Hours: ſo indeed the <hi>Targum</hi> rendreth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and at the firſt view it ſeemeth moſt reaſonable, According to this, the Sun went backwards ten hours, therefore hee had gon forwards 150 Degrees of the Equinoctial line, (for hee is to go everie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58600:139"/> hour fifteen) therefore alſo hee had yet to go thirtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is the complement of 180. the Semicircle of the daie.</p>
                  <p>The time then of the Miracle was within two hours of night, and the Retroceſſion of the Sun it ſelf was as viſible as that of the Shadow: for hee had gon back above three parts of the Hemiſphear.</p>
                  <p>But this could not bee. For the Prophet ask'd the King whether hee would have the Sun go ten degrees forward, or ten degrees backward: but if degrees bee taken for hours would hee ask him whether hee would have the Sun go 10. hours forward, when there was but two to go? For the Sun was then Occidental, 60 degrees paſt the Meridian, and within two hours was to leav that Horizon: So that if the King had required, that the Shadow ſhould have gon 10. degrees forward, the Prophet muſt have gon back from his word; for that which was promiſed was more then could bee don.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it ſeemeth that the degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> are to bee underſtood of thoſe in Heaven, where they are moſt properly and primarily ſo called. Therefore the Sun together with the whole frame of the ſuperior world, went ſo far backward in the diurnal Motion, as made up the ſpace of ten degrees in the Equinoctial Line, which anſwered to two third parts of an hour in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Retroceſſion of the Shadow was much more viſible, then that of the Sun: For wee all know that the ſpace which the Sun goeth in half an hours time and a little more, is better noted in the Dial, then in the Heavens: For, by reaſon of the great diſtance of the Sun's Excentrick from the ſurface of the Earth, the Angle of viſion is ſo Acute, that it cannot transfer a perceivable ſpecies of ſo rapt a motion. And as it cannot bee perceiv'd in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo neither would it eaſily bee obſerved when it was gon; for an Arch of 10. degrees in ſo vaſt an Orb as that of the Sun, would never bee diſtinguiſh'd by thoſe that ſtand here below, unleſs it were Geometrically obſerved by a Quadrant or Aſtrolabe: the knowledg and practice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58600:140"/> I think was not ſo common in the Kingdom of Iſraël. Therefore though the main condition of this Miracle was, that the Sun it ſelf ſhould go back, yet that which was moſt apparent, was the Retroceſſion of the ſhadow: And becauſ <hi>Joſephus</hi> knew that this would bee accepted among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as a matter not without Nature's compaſs, hee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, upon this incouragement, to ſet down the whole won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For it was not his deſire purpoſely to ſmother anie thing that was Miraculous, but onely ſo to qualifie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxall part of things, that they might paſs among the Heathen without ſcorn and deriſion: Therefore in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where there could bee anie pretenſ, hee uſeth no diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. So in the Hiſtorie of <hi>Balaam,</hi> hee durſt to ſaie, that a dumb Aſs forbad the madneſs of the Prophet: 'Twas ſtrange indeed that an Aſs ſhould ſpeak; but why not an Aſs as well as an Ox? which had often hap'ned in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane State; and once above all the reſt <hi>Livie</hi> reporteth, that to the great terror of the Conſul <hi>Domitius,</hi> an Ox uttered theſe words,<note place="margin">Livius lib. <hi>35.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Roma cave tibi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Joſephus</hi> would have been content to do the reſt, if there could have been the like reaſon; but beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to train up the Heathen by Probabilities to a good conceit of his Nation, and thoſe things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them; hee muſt not laie too great a task upon their belief, and therefore ſtill when his Hiſtorie lead's him to the Narration of a ſtrange thing, hee alwaies temper's the diſcourſ with a convenient mixture of Poſſibilities; and howſoever it ſomtimes endanger's the main Matter, yet wee ſhall ſeldom finde him reporting a wonder ſincerely; but having warily taken off that which could ſeem incredible, hee propoſeth the Action under ſuch eaſie circumſtances, as ſhall make it concord with humane reaſon, and common apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>By this time, the Reader may know the Reaſon why <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> when hee is to relate the Hiſtorie of the Seventie, out of <hi>Ariſtaeas,</hi> willingly omitteth this paſſage of the <hi>Cels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ it was like to ſound very incredibly in the Heathen's ears, that a Book ſhould bee ſo prodigiouſly tranſlated; that

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore anie thing can bee directly ſaied to this, wee muſt firſt look a little aſide upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings and improvements of Church-Muſick. In the recollection whereof, not to go ſo far back as <hi>David's</hi> chief Muſicians, or the Father of them that plaie upon the Harp and Organ; It is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a ſet ſolemn waie of Muſical Service, but how to bee compar'd unto, or drawn up to anie correſpondencie with our waies, I know there is one hath undertaken, but doubt, (and more then ſo too) whether anie man is able to perform.</p>
                  <p>As the matter ſtand's within the compaſs of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal time, properly ſo called, The Apoſtolical it ſelf was not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58600:143"/> without ſuch a proportion of that Ceremonie as the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Cradle of the Church could afford, <hi>Carmen Chriſto quaſi Deo canere ſolitos, &amp;c.</hi> That they were wont to ſing an Hymn to Chriſt at their Congregations, it ſeemeth by the Junior <hi>Plinie</hi> to <hi>Trajan.</hi> But their Muſick about that Time was <hi>non clamans, ſed amans;</hi> It had more of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the Voice: ſent up with heart enough; but for the harmonie, much after the rate of their other accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, from the ſimplicitie whereof as unequal time took off, ſo it added to the grace and glorie of it. The Church Muſick had theſe degrees to riſe by; the firſt and rude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance was don <hi>plano cantu,</hi> by Plain ſong; as the Pſalms are moſt ordinarily read in Cathedrals, or at the beſt, but as they uſe to bee ſung in Parochial Churches, where though ſomtimes the noiſ may ſeem to pretend to a daſh and ſprinkling of Art, 'tis moſt commonly (and 'tis well if it bee no worſ) but all in the ſame Time and Tune: from Plain Song they got up to Diſcant; and firſt of all to <hi>contrapunctum ſimplex,</hi> a ſimple kinde of Counterpoint, and then Muſick was in Parts, They ſung not all the ſame tune, but by waie of conſonancie, yet ſo as the Muſick anſwered note for note: as if there ſtood a Minim or Sembrief in the upper part, there ſtood another againſt it in the lower and inner parts: ſo that this Muſick needed no bars.</p>
                  <p>To this the rare, but intemperate Invention of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hath added the <hi>Contrapunctum figuratum,</hi> conſiſting of Feuges, or mainteining of Points, alteration of the Keies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>And now it may bee thought that the Antiquitie of the <hi>Organ</hi> is brought far enough back. 'Tis true for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;<note place="margin">Zonar. Tom. <hi>3.</hi> Annal. in Michaele Imperator. p. <hi>127.</hi>
                     </note> but for the Church uſe I am in doubt. <hi>Zonaras</hi> telleth us of an <hi>Organ</hi> ſet up by one of the Greek Emperors, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I had occaſion to ſhew an <hi>Armenian</hi> Prieſt the Chappel here, and perceiving him to caſt his eie upon the <hi>Organ,</hi> I asked, whether there were anie ſuch ſight to bee ſeen in their Churches? Hee anſwered, No ſuch matter: neither did hee know till it was told him, what to call them; and yet this man had liv'd 14 years under two Patriarchs, <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more then this. In the Greek Liturgies I meet with Muſick enough, and more indeed, then I can tell what to ſaie to, but not ſo much as the mention of an <hi>Organ</hi> in all their Books. The old Greek-Latine gloſs ſetteth down <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>§. Note one thing more, That the moſt antient and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal form of Chriſtian Liturgie, is the order of Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt bee ſo in reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from thence the main parts of all Common Praiers are tranſlated; the Creeds eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for thoſe, and the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> were the firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and gave begining to all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service.</p>
                  <p>And if a caſe ſhould lie againſt the <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> I hold the ground to bee good from hence, that it was not properly put into the Liturgie, becauſ it was not yet received into anie order of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Creed</hi> in uſe, before the Fathers met at <hi>Nice,</hi> muſt needs bee that which is called Apoſtolical; for they had no other: But ſince the Councel, the <hi>Nicene</hi> form was generally received into all Orders of Baptiſm in the other Church, as the Greek, Syriack, Ethiopick, Armenian and Coptick Orders: But the Rubrick in all is as in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, <hi>Haiden amar,</hi> not then the Prieſt ſhall ſing; but, <hi>Tum dicit Sacerdos, Credo in unum Deum, &amp;c.</hi> In the Latine Church indeed, ſomtimes the <hi>Symbolum Conſtantinopolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> was repeted, but moſt commonly the <hi>Nicene.</hi> And all the Romane Tradition faſteneth the Inſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon the times of Pope <hi>Mark,</hi> which was about the Year 366. and immediately ſucceeding upon the Councel it ſelf. And for the manner of Recitation, <hi>Berno</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ille enim ob Arrianorum haereſin Symbolum Nic num in Miſſa
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58600:145"/> decantari ordinavit, &amp;c</hi> Another ſaith, That hee ordained it ſhould bee don <hi>Altâ voce;</hi> And the ſame Father ſaith, That by a Canon of the third Councel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> it was ordered concerning the <hi>Creed,</hi> that it ſhould bee <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim clarâ voce decantatum, ſecundùm formam Eccleſiarum Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now out of all this to frame an Anſwer to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By all the Orders of Baptiſm, the <hi>Catechumenus</hi> was firſt to make his Abrenunciation, to renounce the Divel and all his works. And this hee did with his face turned towards the Weſt. That don, hee was to turn himſelf towards the Eaſt, and make profeſſion of his Faith in the words of the <hi>Nicene</hi> form (ſince the Councel) But which is principally to bee noted (as to this buſineſs) all this was to bee don <hi>Altâ voce.</hi> The Church as it received the Form from the order of Baptiſm, ſo it reteined the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of converſion (towards the Eaſt) and manner of pronunciation.</p>
                  <p>So much therefore is certain, that the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> (or what form ſoever) was alwaies recited in a different Tone, A louder voice at the leaſt: but, becauſ the Canon maketh mention of <hi>Decantari,</hi> and that this was to bee don <hi>ſecundùm formam Eccleſiarum Orientalium:</hi> Two things will bee granted upon this: One is, That there was a kinde of Modulation in the Pronouncing of the <hi>Creed;</hi> another is, That this was not Romane in the <hi>Original,</hi> but from Eaſtern Example. The Summ of both is, That either the words <hi>dici &amp; decantari</hi> muſt bee confounded: or that, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good ſimplicitie of time, the pronunciation was made by <hi>Dici,</hi> onely with the difference of <hi>Altâ voce,</hi> but afterwards graced with a meaſure of Harmonie; yet ſuch an one, as cannot bee compared higher, then to the matter of Plain-ſong; for I am deceived, if the Eaſtern Muſick ever improved further. Antiphones I know they had, and upon what Seraphical occaſion, if <hi>Sozomen</hi> deliver it rightly; but this came to no more then our alternation, at the moſt ordinarie ſinging of the Pſalms, by waie of Reſponds, but all in the ſame time and tune, &amp; without anie Diſcant at all.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:58600:145"/>
                  <p>Therefore to ſaie all at once. The Singing of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Creed,</hi> as now it is, with all the Ornaments and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Harmonie, is but a Yeſterdaies buſineſs, and contemporarie to the <hi>Organ,</hi> but however the ſame <hi>Creed</hi> hath been moſt certainly Sung according to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time, and at the leaſt <hi>in plano Cantu,</hi> in a plain Song-faſhion, ever ſince the date of the Councel it ſelf, and for the Reaſon given out of the Order of Baptiſm.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Scripture ſpeak's of Mens departure from hence, the uſual Phraſe is, not to ſaie ſuch an one <hi>died;</hi> but, ſuch an one <hi>ſlept</hi> with his Fathers. And the ſame Spirit ſpeaketh to the Dead, but as wee would do to thoſe that are not yet ſtirring. <hi>Awake, awake, Sing yee that dwell in the duſt.</hi>

                  <p>Wee are all here but Strangers and Pilgrims; and our beeing here wee uſe to call but This, that is no, Life; but the Paſſage, and Journie to another. <hi>While 'tis called to daie,</hi> wee travel on through the waies of this World: but the <hi>Night cometh, and no man can work</hi> at the approach of this Evening.

                  <p>When wee go to take our Natural reſt, wee enter into our Chambers, and ſhut the doors. Such a Room as this is the Sepulcher. A Church-yard, in the expreſſion of the Antients, was but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Having entered our Chambers, and ſhut the door, the next thing wee do, is, to commend our ſelvs to God. So the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> when hee was to fall into that other ſleep, firſt ſaid his Praiers; <hi>Lord Jeſu receiv my Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>This don, wee put off our Clothes: So <hi>Naked wee came into this World, and Naked wee ſhall go out, &amp;c.</hi> The Raiment of a Man, (ſaith a Learned <hi>Rabbin</hi>) is his Bodie: And, had our Father <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, wee had needed no other. <hi>Thou haſt Clothed mee,</hi> ſaith holie <hi>Job, with Skin, and with Fleſh:</hi> when therefore wee die, wee are ſaid, in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s language, to <hi>put off this Tabernacle;</hi> as, in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when <hi>wee riſe again, to bee Clothed upon with our houſ from Heaven.</hi> O're night wee put off this weed of Mortalitie: but the Morning cometh, and wee ſhall bee covered again with our skin; and put on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, our Better Cloths, as to go and ſee God in this Fleſh. The ſame fleſh wee put off the night before; but with this difference, that this Fowl Garment, which could not bee kept Unſpotted of the world, ſhall in the mean time bee waſhed clean in the Blood of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p>Our Clothes put off, wee laie our ſelvs down, and take our reſt: And, to Die, in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Phraſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.17. &amp; 57.1.</note> is but to <hi>lie down in our Beds. And when thy daies ſhall bee fulfilled,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, and thou ſhalt ſleep with thy Fathers:</hi> ſo indeed wee read it, as wee may; but the Original is, And <hi>thou ſhalt lie down with thy Fathers.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. So <hi>Aſa,</hi> the King's Coffin is called a Bed. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 16.14. and our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, in their <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, ſtyle a Burying place, <hi>legerstoƿ,</hi> or place to lie down in: as in the Laws of King <hi>Canute. Numb.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>In the Caſe of Natural Reſt, 'tis not the whole man, onely the Earthlie part falleth aſleep; the Soul is then moſt awake. The Bodie's Night is the Soul's Daie: our Better part, ſaith <hi>Cardan,</hi> is never it's own man till now, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted unto a State of Separation, (as it were) in the bodie, it ſpendeth the time in Contemplations, free, and congeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to its own Extraction. So in the ſleep of Death, 'tis not the <hi>totus Homo:</hi> the Bodie indeed is dead, becauſ of ſin; the Soul is then moſt Alive. Here, as a Servant, it is ſtill
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58600:150"/> required to the Exigencies of the Bodie; having no time of it's own to ſpend, but what it can get by ſtealth, when the Maſter is gon to bed. But there, like it's Redeemer, free among the Dead, and delivered from the Incumbrances of the Bodie, it begineth to bee a Soul to it ſelf, minding that which is above, and looking with a more piercing eie upon the Inviſible things of God.</p>
                  <p>It is noted by the Naturaliſts, and wee finde it true in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that no noiſ awaketh Natural Sleep more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, then an Humane voice: Nay, though it bee that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that dead and dangerous ſleep; as the Aphoriſm noteth it in <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But eſpecially the Experiment hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if the voice calleth upon him in his own name. But, that wee ſhall all bee awaked out of this other Sleep, by the ſound of our Proper Names, is more then I can pretend to: though S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s call was, <hi>Tabitha ſurge;</hi> and our Saviour's to his Friend, <hi>Lazare veni foras, Lazarus</hi> com forth. To ſaie nothing to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Tradition, that, when our Lord went down into Hell, and there found our Father <hi>Adam</hi> faſt; hee took him by the hand, and called him by his own Name, in the words of S. <hi>Paul, Surge Adam qui dormis</hi> (ſo indeed ſom Antient Copies read it,) <hi>Ariſe Adam, thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead,</hi> Chriſt taketh thee by the hand. But this I am ſure of, that wee ſhall all bee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a voice, the voice of an Archangel; and the word ſhall bee, as ſom think, <hi>Surgite mortui, &amp;c.</hi> Nor ſhall it bee the voice of a God, and not of a Man; it ſhall bee an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane voice: for, by the Archangel, wee are to mean the <hi>Son of Man. For the hour cometh, in which all they that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall com forth, Job.</hi> 5.28. Which why it ſhould bee ſtrange of us, I know not; ſince it is true of the Swallows, by a certain and confeſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that when the Winter cometh, they lie down in the hollow of a Tree, and there falling aſleep, quietly reſolv into their firſt Principles: But at the Spring's approach, they are not ſo (though throughly) dead, but that they hear the ſtil noiſ of Returning Nature, and awaking out of their Maſs, riſe up everie one to their life again. <hi>Ego novi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58600:150"/> &amp;c.</hi> I know a man (ſaith the Learned Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi>) who, in his ſoundeſt Sleep, could walk, talk, write, and diſpatch anie buſineſs of the moſt required Vigilance. They ſeem to have had ſom ſuch conceit of Death, who hold it no abſurditie, to write Letters to their dead Friends; as the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> more then thirtie Years after his deceaſ; as if Death were a kinde of live Sleep; Such an one as that, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſent of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, to awake <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> And may wee not as properly ſaie, that to bee Dead, is to bee Alive; as to ſaie, to Die, is to bee Born? And yet the Antients (as if Corruption had been their Father, and the Worms their Mother) were wont to call the daies of their Death, <hi>Natalia,</hi> not Dying, but Birth-daies. <hi>Mos inolevit in ſancta Eccleſia,</hi> it hath been the cuſtom in the holie Church, (ſaith <hi>Haymo,</hi>) when a Saint of God departed this life, to call it not the daie of his Death, but the daie of his Nativitie. That which wee call Death's, they call Life's door: <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf ſaid as much; <hi>Dies iſte, quem Tutanquam Supremum reformidas, Aeterni Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſt.</hi> As if all this were ſo indeed, the <hi>Jews</hi> to this daie, ſtick not to call their <hi>Golgotha</hi>'s, <hi>Batte Caiim,</hi> the Houſes, or places of the Living. At the leaſt they have an Effectual life in them: for the <hi>Mummies</hi> are known to bee moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and Magiſtral in Medicine; and the Principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of the weapon-Salv, is the Moſs of a dead Man's-skul: as the <hi>Recipe,</hi> delivered by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Once more, and I leav the Parallel. Sleep, wee know, is moſt natural to Animal-Creatures; and for Men ſo Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that the end of it in us, is, <hi>Bene Ratiocinari.</hi> And yet hee himſelf is cited by <hi>Olympiodorus,</hi> to have known a Man, who never ſlept in all his Life. And the ſtrangeneſs hath been quitted by an Experience of later daies. The Compariſon holdeth in the Sleep of Death: 'tis <hi>Omnibus communis,</hi> common to all men, as wee uſe to ſaie. And yet ſom <hi>Jews</hi> believ, that the laſt age of Men ſhall bee ſo long liv'd, as to prevent the Reſurrection; But S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf hath promiſed, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>that wee ſhall not all die;</hi> ſom <hi>ſhall bee changed.</hi> And therefore 'tis no vain Article, which wee ſo daily profeſs; that our Saviour ſhall com to judg both the Quick and the Dead: Wee are to ſaie then of all thoſe that are departed this life, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of their Father <hi>Jacob; Non eſt Mortuus:</hi> or, as our Saviour of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the <hi>Maid; Why trouble you your ſelvs? they are not Dead, but Sleep.</hi> And when a Friend leaveth this world, wee are to bid him but Good Night; in ſure and certain <hi>Hope</hi> to meet again, in the great Morning of the World.</p>
                  <p>But now, <hi>How long, how long, Lord, Holie and True?</hi> will ſom ſaie: or, as thoſe in S. <hi>Peter, Where is the promiſe of his Coming? For, ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue to bee as they were from the begining to the Creätion.</hi> But theſe Men have not the knowledg; and this is to bee ſpoken to their ſhame. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack, as concerning his Promiſe: for, Behold, hee cometh quickly; and his Reward is with him.</hi> When wee awake out of our natural ſleep, bee the Night never ſo long, to us it ſeemeth but a Moment. And the Night is no longer, in the Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. For, <hi>his Anger endureth but a Moment:</hi> that is, weeping may endure for a Night, but joie cometh in the Morning. 'Tis no otherwiſe in Death: for, when firſt wee awake out of this ſleep, wee ſhall think that wee did but then lie down; and were it a thouſand Years, it would ſeem no more to us, then it doth to God himſelf; <hi>but as one daie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is Obſervable, that the Holie Ghoſt, which accounteth Natural Death, as a Sleep, yet calleth the Life of a Sinner by the name of Death. To bee truly Dead, is, to bee Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins: And therefore S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not making mention of the Great Reſurrection, bid's his <hi>Corinthians</hi> awake to Righteouſneſs, and ſin not. For a Righteous man hath more Hope in his Death, then a Sinner in his Life: and no man can bee Dead to Nature, that is Alive to God.</p>
                  <p>But, if to Die bee but to fall Aſleep; wee ſhould put off this Garment of Fleſh with as good a will, as wee do our Clothes. And that wee may ſleep well in the night, wee ſhould forbear ſleeping in the Daie, not Idleing in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58600:151"/> as thoſe in the <hi>Parable;</hi> nor ſitting down <hi>in the ſeat of the ſcornful:</hi> but <hi>working out our ſalvation:</hi> for the Sleep of a Laboring man is ſweet.</p>
                  <p>And that wee may reſt in theſe Beds, in an undiſturbed peace, wee are to provide, that no Innate Furies, no Stings of Death, like groſs and reſtleſs Vapors, do ariſe from a guiltie Conſcience. Such a man will bee ſcared with Dreams, and terrified with Viſions, and bee full of toſſings to and fro, until the dawning of the the daie. <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſ to the Conciliation of Reſt and Sleep, it is required that there bee a Moderate Repletion, (for <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> maketh this to bee of the Definition:) wee are by no means to go to bed, till firſt of all wee have ſate down to the Great Supper; till wee have eaten of that Bread, and drank of that Cup, which ſhew the Lords Death (but our Life) till hee com; and are therefore, not unfitly, termed by the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene Councel, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>I Said, that was twofold: Frſt of the <hi>first Fruits:</hi> then of the <hi>whole Lump.</hi> And firſt of the <hi>Reſurrection of our Saviour;</hi> but, which I am not here to make Proof of; for it is taken for granted in the Text. But if anie ſhould bee ſo fooliſh, and ſlow of heart, as not to believ all that is written in the Prophets; the Heathen <hi>Tacitus</hi> will tell you one Article, in the 15 of his Annals; <hi>That hee ſuffered under Pontius Pilate:</hi> And the Jew <hi>Joſephus</hi> addeth the other, in the 18. of his <hi>Antiquities; That hee roſe again the third daie from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which moſt properly I am to make known to you is, upon what Conſideration our Saviour can bee called <hi>The Firſt:</hi> then, by what Analogie <hi>The firſt Fruits.</hi> The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58600:152"/> Patriarch <hi>Enoch</hi> was Tranſlated; and the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> went up to Heaven in a fierie Chariot: And the Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes</hi> hath been diſputed for by ſom; though it ſhould ſeem, by the Contention betwix the Arch-Angel and the Divel about his bodie, that there was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Howſoever, theſe all rather died not, then roſe again. As for the Riſing of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to which the Cunning Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Endor</hi> pretended, it was nothing leſs then a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; 'twas an Apparition. And <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould have ſaid to the Woman, as Hee to Her: Why haſt thou deceived mee? for this is not <hi>Samuel. Eliſha</hi> indeed raiſed up the <hi>Shunamite</hi>'s Son: and our Saviour raiſed up his friend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> after hee had been Dead four daies: And yet ſtill This was the <hi>firſt Reſurrection.</hi> The reſt did not go before, as the Scripture ſeemeth to ſaie, but follow'd This. For, as hee was a Lamb, ſlain; ſo was hee a Lamb Riſen too, from the begining of the World. The reſt were Raiſed, Hee onely <hi>Roſe from the Dead. Eliſha</hi>'s dead Bones raiſed up Another Man's; Our Saviour's dead Bones raiſed up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs. They raiſed Others, by His power; Hee, Himſelf by his own.</p>
                  <p>To ſaie therefore, there was anie Reſurrection before This, is to ſaie, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was before <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The reſt were all but ſecond Brothers in the Reſurrection: Hee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>Primogenitus Mortuorum,</hi> the firſt begotten of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Wee have ſeen in what ſenſ our Saviour is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Firſt: I am now to tell you, in what Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee ſtandeth to the <hi>Firſt Fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then I am to lead you back to the Old Law, of the <hi>Omer,</hi> or <hi>Sheaf. Levit.</hi> 23.9. Where the Children of Ifraël are commanded, that at the reaping of their Harveſt no Bread, or Parched Corn, or Green Ears bee eaten in their dwellings, till a Sheaf of the Frſt Fruits bee offered, and Waved before the Lord, together with a Lamb for a Burnt Offering. The Traditions here (and not unneceſſarily) ſupplie; that, thoſe who lived far from the Holie Citie, might eat of the New Corn, when Mid-daie was paſt: for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58600:152"/> that is was preſumed, the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> would ſee the Sheaf offered up ere that time. Thus the Letter, and Cerimonie: which, how well it is anſwered in the Truth, and Subſtance, I ſhall briefly ſhew you.</p>
                  <p>The Typical Sheaf, (as the Doctors deliver in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi>) was to bee cut down in the Night: So was the <hi>True.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Codmenac.</note> Hee was cut down indeed in the Daie time; but the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the greater: for the verie Light of This Daie was Darkneſs; and therefore how great was that? A dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that indeed might bee felt. A darkneſs over the face of the whole Earth: Such an one, as in the Begining was over the face of the Deep, before the Creator had ſaid, <hi>Let there bee Light.</hi> And though the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of Darkneſs till the Ninth hour; yet moſt certain it is, that That Daie had another Darkneſs, about the Twelfth hour, of Nature's own Proviſion. For, by the Aſtronomical Tables, the Moon was at that time almoſt totally Eclipſed: So truly were theſe Firſt Fruits cut down in the Night,</p>
                  <p>The Typical Sheaf thus reaped down, was carried into the Court-yard of the Sanctuarie, threſhed, parched, ground; then lifted up, and waved before the Lord: So was the <hi>True.</hi> The manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> Threſhing was by the Treading of Oxen, and Wheels indented with iron teeth. And did not manie Buls compaſs Him about? And was not Hee <hi>bruiſed for our Tranſgreſsions?</hi> His Hands, and his Feet were pierced; and all his Bones were out of joint: they had been broken too, but for the Prophecie. Hee was Parched: for, was not his ſtrength dried up, as a Pot-ſheard? Did not his Tongue cleav to the roof of his Mouth? And was hee not brought down to the duſt of Death? You may hear him ſaie all this himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. Hee was lifted up too: for, <hi>as Moſes l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo was the Son, &amp;c.</hi> And hee was waved too, (as ſom compare it) by an Earthquake, at the Reſurrection. But inſtead of Waving, the Text tranſlateth it; The Sheaf was Separated. So were theſe firſt Fruits: and the Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſo great, that hee cried out, His God, His God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58600:153"/> him. Laſtly, there was an Extraordinarie Lamb to bee offered up, as due to the Sheaf. And if one ſhould ask us, as once the Son did the Father; <hi>Behold the fire, and the wood; but where is the Lamb for a burnt Offering?</hi> Hee would bee anſwered, that <hi>God would provide himſelf a Lamb. Ecce Agnus Dei,</hi> Behold the Lamb of God. But that which moſt of all concern's is, the Condition of the Firſt Fruits: That was, till Theſe were offered up no Man of the Land of Iſrael might eat of his New Corn; 'twas yet Profane, and Curſed, as the Ground that bare it. But, the Sheaf once offered up, the whole Crop is intituled to the Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, <hi>if the Firſt Fruits bee holie,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, then ſo is alſo the whole lump.</hi> This alſo is the caſe of the Reſurrection: for, if Chriſt, the firſt Fruits, bee riſen; then They alſo that are His, the whole Lump, at his Coming. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is the end of the World; and the end of our Life is in the ſeed time: Church-yards are the Plots; which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the high Dutch moſt properly term, <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Aeres,</hi> or <hi>Glebe Land,</hi> wherein the Dead are ſown a Natural bodie; but the Crop ſhall not bee ſuch, as wherewith the Mower filleth not his hand, or hee that bindeth up the Sheafs his boſom. It ſhall bee with the Fat of the Kidnies of Wheat, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Song. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. 'Tis ſown in Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; it riſeth again in Glorie. And the Reapers are the Angels, who ſhall gather and binde us up again <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Betſror hachaiim,</hi> into the Bundle of Life, as in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.29. which words therefore the Jews uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete in their Diriges, and inſcribe upon their Tombs.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Fruits beeing riſen; take anie one of us anie grain of Corn in the whole Lump, and caſt it into the ground, if it die not, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much Fruit. For the Life of the Lump, like Corn in the Earth, is laied in the Firſt Fruits in God: The inſtance of the Corn is ſo pregnant, that the Greek Churches, in their Commemorations of the Dead; uſe to boil Wheat in water, and ſet it before them, as a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Symbol of the Reſurrection. And my Autor is bold to ſaie, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58600:153"/> that This is the Greater wonder of the two; that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Corn is more Prodigious then that of the Bodie. Strange indeed it is, that a grain of Corn ſhould not quicken, except it die: But much more ſtrange, that out of one grain, and one as good as Dead, ſhould ſpring forth ſuch a Numerous Increaſ. As for our Bodies, which are ſown in Corruption; the Earth, when ſhee ſhall give up her Dead, will render, but as the Talent hid in the Napkin, the ſame again; or one for another. But the Husbandman receiveth his own with Intereſt: ſhall I ſaie that this Grain hath gained him Ten Grains? Nay, in ſom parts under the Line, they reap the profit of a Thouſand for One.</p>
                  <p>In Relation to the Firſt Fruits, wee are called by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

Correſpondently the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our bones ſhall flourish like an Herb.</hi> Now the Herbs and Plants, wee know, however cut down, yet reinforcing from the Root, ſpring up, and riſe again. Wee uſe Vulgarly, but Improperly, to call the uppermoſt of the Branches, the Top of a Tree: but wee are corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the Books <hi>De Anima;</hi> where wee are taught to call the Root, the Head; and the Top, the Feet. In the Reverſ of this Compariſon, the firſt Fruits are the Root, and the Head; wee, the Branches, or Members. And in the 36. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Head acknowledgeth the whole departed Race of Mankinde to bee his Trunk, or Dead Bodie. Wee read it: <hi>Thy Dead Men shall ariſe;</hi> With my dead Bodie ſhall they ariſe. But the reſt is put in by the Tranſlators: The Original is, <hi>Thy dead Men shall ariſe:</hi> they ſhall ariſe, my dead Bodie. Seeing therefore that the Ax is not laid to the Root of the Tree, what though the Branches bee lopt off by Death, there is ſtill Hope in the Tree, ſaith Holie <hi>Job.</hi> For though the Stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the ſent of water, 'twill bud and bring forth boughs like a Plant; which withereth over night: but beeing watered with the dew of Heaven, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up afreſh in the Morning. And therefore in the ſame

But wee are not to give heed unto Jewiſh Fables: and therefore it ſhall not bee here enquired, who ſhall bee the Father of this Rain; or, Who ſhould beget theſe drops of Dew. Sure wee are, that though touch'd by Death wee ſhrink up, like that ſenſitive Plant: yet wee ſhall ſoon quicken by his Influence, whoſe <hi>Head</hi> (in the <hi>Canticles) is fill'd with Dew; and his Looks as with the drops of the night.</hi> In Exprobration therefore unto Death, and Mortalitie, wee know whoſe uſe it was to burie their dead in their Gardens; ſowing their Bodies with as much faith, as their Fruits, and equally exſpecting the ſpring of Both. 'Tis for no other reaſon, that wee ourſelvs ſtick our Hearſes with Flowers, and go forth to the grave with Roſemarie. Our Precedents were the Jews, whoſe antient Cuſtom it was by the waie as they went with their Corpſes, to pluck everie one up the Graſs; as who ſhould ſaie, they were not ſorrie, as men without Hope; for, their brother was but ſo crop't off, and ſhould ſpring up again in his due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>But the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Compariſon of the Flouriſhing of our Bones like an Herb, is yet further made good, by (as I think) one of the greateſt Secrets, that are yet known in Nature. A Learned Chymiſt, who ſpent much time in the Contemplation of Tinctures, and Impreſſions of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to prove the Great Principle of Salt, made this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. Hee took ſeveral Herbs, and Plants, and calcined them to Aſhes: hee put up the Aſhes into ſeveral Glaſſes, ſealed Hermetically, and written upon with the ſeveral names of the Calcined Herbs. When hee would ſhew the Experiment, hee applied a ſoft flame to the Glaſſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthwith hee might perceiv the ſelf ſame Herbs riſing up by little and little out of the Aſhes, everie one in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form: and, the flame ſubtracted, they would return to their own Chaos again.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58600:154"/>
                  <p>The Spectators, as the Chymiſt, beheld this with the greateſt Admiration; and giving thanks to God, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from thence the Reſurrection of the Dead Bodie.</p>
                  <p>Wee may take an Omen of our Riſing again, from the Time of our Saviour's Reſurrection. The firſt fruits roſe in the Spring: and that's the time (ſo the Senator <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius</hi>) wherein the Phenix riſeth out of her aſhes. And 'tis the time wherein the <hi>Egyptians</hi> celebrate their Annual Reſurrection: for upon the 26. of March, they ſolemnly go to a place by <hi>Nile,</hi> where they ſee, and touch the Bodies Riſing out of their Graves. It will ſeem ſtrange, I confeſs, but it hath been ſeriouſly teſtified, and believed. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wee ſhall take this, but as a ſtaff of <hi>Egypt;</hi> a broken Reed, or, but ſuch an one, as <hi>Gehazi</hi> laid upon the Dead Childe. But the maſter cometh ſhortly, and ſhall command the Breath to com from the four Winds, and breath upon our Slain; and then theſe Bones ſhall live.</p>
                  <p>But I would not have this Doctrine two partially appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: our Saviour indeed is ſaid to bee <hi>the firſt Fruits of them that ſleep</hi> in Him. Thoſe that ſleep in Him, are ſuch, which here awake and ſtand up from the Death of ſin. For, as there is a ſecond Death; ſo, Here is a firſt Reſurrection. In the great morning of the World the Dew ſhall fall down upon the dead in Chriſt; as that other Dew upon the Fleece of <hi>Gideon;</hi> and the reſt of Mankinde ſhall bee drie. But another dew ſhall fall upon the ungodlie; a Blaſting Mildew: and then the reſt of the ground ſhall bee wet, and the Fleece onely ſhall bee drie. <hi>The 'wicked lie in the graves like Sheep,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) that are appointed to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Righteous shall have dominion over them in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In the field of the World, where our Saviour is the firſt Fruits, the Good are the Wheat; and the Bad are the Tares: which as they both are cut down alike, ſo ſhall they both alike bee gathered up: But the Tares for the Fire; and the good Corn for the great Husbandman's Barn. They ſeem indeed to bee of the Lump; but no more title to the Firſt Fruits, then that, as theſe were cut down, ſo thoſe were ſowed in the Night.</p>

                  <p>If theſe things bee ſo, what manner of perſons ought wee to bee, in all holie Converſation? But if the Reſurrection were to bee argued from the Sanctitie of Life; there was never leſs Hope of it, then now. Nay, wee take the onely courſ to prove that our Saviour is not yet Riſen. 'Tis but the Converſion of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propoſition: <hi>If Chriſt bee not riſen; then you are yet in your ſins:</hi> But you are yet in your ſins: and yee know what follow's.</p>

                     <hi>In all holie converſation, &amp;c.</hi> Why, there was never more Holineſs pretended to; never leſs practiſed then now. And yee muſt not count mee your Enemie, becauſ I tell you this Truth What ſtreining here is at the Gnat of a Cerimonie; by them which can ſwallow whole Camels of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Abominations? How odious is the verie name of a Cope, or a Surplice to thoſe, which yet can love the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted with the Fleſh? All poſſible means hath been taken, to purge the material Temple of anie ſuſpicious Ruſt, contracted by the inconſiderations of Time: but the Temples of our Bodies, and they ſhould bee thoſe of the Holie Ghoſt, they are Painted ſtill, <hi>Painted Sepulchers.</hi> They appear well outwardly; and wee have been perſuaded to waſh our ſelvs in <hi>Jordan,</hi> from the Romiſh Leproſie: wee do well; onely in this, the Lord bee merciful unto mee.

                  <p>If it bee well to deface a Picture in a Church; will it not bee much better, to reſtore the Image of God in our ſelvs? I do not ſaie that theſe things ought they not to have don: I leav that to a higher Diſcretion: but, I may, and muſt ſaie that if the other things bee left undon, yee have but waſh'd the outſide of the Platter.

                  <p>The Bodie and Blood of Chriſt; are the Sacraments of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58600:155"/> Reſurrection: but, can I think them to bee ſo, to Them, who ſo duely com to Receiv them unworthily. It is the cauſ, (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) manie are weak and ſicklie among you, and manie ſleep.</p>

                  <p>For the Tranſlation, I believ it to bee that which for the greateſt part of the main bodie is yet exſtant, and that it was performed at ſuch a Time and Place, and poſſibly by ſuch a Number of Elders; for the Cels, the Separation, and miraculous concent of the Interpreters, with other pompous circumſtances remembred by <hi>Ariſteas,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf they were all afterwards deviſed by the Helleniſts to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the reputation of their Scripture, againſt that of the other murmuring Jews: which, derived down to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church in ſuch a diſguiſ of Miracle and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and which is more then that, expreſly quoted by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, rather then the Original, was eaſily received with that precipitation of Reverence, as gave not time to conſider what licentious courſes had been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed upon it.</p>
                  <p>In this Tranſlation as now received, beſides manie other various Readings, two irreconciliable differences from the Original have paſſed, the one purely Chronological by a numerous exceſs in the Anni <gap reason="foreign">

There was reaſon for it, for it pleaſed God (who even in theſe things deſpiſeth not the waies of Men) that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture might bee the ſooner known, and to the more, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to paſs rather by the ſtreams, then from the fountains, to which the acceſs was harder, and the differences but ſuch as imported no ſubſtantial inconvenience in the waies of ſalvation.</p>

Of the Fleſh decocted to a Jellie, they make their Unguents, with which they do things of ſo rare and unreaſonable conſequence.

                     <p>If this were the reaſon, it ſeemeth a little to reflect upon the matter of the Innocents.</p>
                     <p>But indeed if the Storie had been fully and expreſly ſet down, it muſt have gon for nothing. For this is but that <hi>Philo,</hi> which with others of the like pretended Autoritie, <hi>(Beroſus, Metaſthenes &amp;c.) Amius</hi> the Monk hath ſo lately obtruded to this world. But the impudent forgeries of this fellow, the learned <hi>Joſeph Scaliger, Sethus Calviſius, &amp;c.</hi> have verie quickly and ſufficiently chaſtiſed.</p>
                     <p>And yet this ignorant Man is as reverently quoted by <hi>Rabbi Azarias</hi> in his <hi>Meor Enaiim,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Meor Enai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im fol. <hi>89.</hi> &amp;c.</note> as if hee had written the <hi>Wiſdom of Salomon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the ſtrangeſt thing indeed is, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf ſhould take no notice of this matter, not onely not of the ſaying of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but nothing neither of the killing of the children, a Paſſage verie unexſpectedly omitted by ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58600:169"/> great a Courtier and ſo good an Hiſtorian, eſpecially one that ſpared not to ſet forth the reſt of <hi>Herod</hi>'s indignities to the full.</p>
                     <p>It is enough to draw ſom doubt upon the Tradition of <hi>Macrobius. Joſeph Scaliger</hi> believeth it all; but yet his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſhould make ſuch a return upon <hi>Herod,</hi> ſeeing that hee himſelf did the Murther, not onely upon this, but upon all the three ſons. I do not perceiv that the Learned Man hath cauſ enough. <hi>Herod</hi> did but caſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious part upon the Emperor (and officiouſly too) but left the main and principal guilt upon his own head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nevertheleſs, to all this the Emperor might verie fitly retort, as hee did, That it were better to bee <hi>Herod</hi>'s Hog then his Son.</p>
                     <p>But what ſon of <hi>Herod</hi>'s could this bee? It muſt bee <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater;</hi> or it muſt bee none. But <hi>Antipater</hi> was more a man then to bee reckoned among the children of two years old and under. And moreover then that, <hi>Antipater</hi> was not at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> nor thereabouts at that time.</p>
                     <p>I know not upon what terms to make this hold, unleſs it may bee thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> had obteined of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the killing of two ſons already, and now ſolicited for the third. It was preſently upon the killing of the Infants that <hi>Herod</hi>'s Meſſengers came to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Accuſations of his ſon <hi>Antipater,</hi> and ſo both the Paſſages came to the Emperors ear at the ſame time, and this later, for the nearneſs was miſreckoned into the bargain.</p>
                     <p>There is another Circumſtance or two, which make the Murther ſo much the more concerning.</p>
                     <p>One is,</p>

By the Tumors about his feet you would judg him to bee Hydropical, To this a ſtrange inflammation of the lower Bellie, and ſuch a putrefaction of the Genitals as bred Worms; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over then this, a ſhortneſs and difficultie of Breathing, with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of all the Parts.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath a fuller Tradition of this Event, <hi>C.</hi> 8. of the 17. Book of his Antiquities. And if you conſider the common Tranſlations of both, you will finde it fit that this other ſhould bee ſet down here too. The matter will not onely bee to turn the Greek, but (if it may bee) to render it ſo, that eſpecially the words may ſignifie a diſtinct and Artificial deſcription of <hi>Herod</hi>'s diſeaſ, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> mean't, and indeed expreſt it like himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I do not threaten here to do verie much neither: This I am ſure of; The Tranſlators underſtood the matter but meanly, (and yet one of them was a Phyſician too).

There happened to com to Town a Roguie Fidler, who undertook preſently to quit the Place of all the Vermin, upon condition to receiv ſuch a ſumm of monie for his pains. The Burgers agreed. The Fidler betook him to his Pipe, at the ſound whereof the Rats came all forth, and followed the fellow quite through the Town to the River Weser, where they were all drown'd. The Piper (the <hi>Pid'e Piper</hi> they call'd him) came to demand his monie: but the ſumm was now thought to bee too much, eſpecially the thing beeing don ſo eaſily too, and ſo unexſpectedly: yet they allotted him a good ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reward; but the fellow would have his bargain, all or

And all the Children fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him out of the Town, to the vale of <hi>Koppenburgh,</hi> where the Mountain ſeemed to open and receiv in theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones into a prepoſterous womb, and ſo cloſed up again. but certain it is, that it was never yet heard of where, or how that Earth delivered her ſelf of theſe children again.

                     <p>As inſtead of S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s daie, they ſet you down in a Picture, a Schoolmaſter holding a Rod and Ferula in his hands.

                     <p>It hath been a cuſtom, and yet is elſwhere, to whip up the children upon <hi>Innocent</hi>'s daie morning, that the memorie of this Murther might ſtick the cloſer, and in a moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to act over the crueltie again in kinde.</p>

                  <p>The Sun's Year is the Revolution of his Motion in the Ecliptick, which if it bee accounted in the Zodiack, it uſeth to bee called <hi>Annus Temporalis,</hi> becauſ it ſo diſtinguiſheth the <hi>quatuor Tempora,</hi> Summer, Winter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is otherwiſe term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and indeed moſt properly) <hi>Annus Tropicus</hi> or <hi>vertens,</hi> becauſ the Aſtronomers of old reckoned this Year from the Tropicks firſt, as it may ſeem, though after alſo from the Equinoctial's depending upon the Sun's entrance into theſe Points,<note place="margin">Cabaſil. in <hi>3.</hi> Ptolem.

                  <p>If the Revolution bee accounted from anie fixed Star to the ſame again, the Year is then called <hi>Annus Sidereus,</hi> firſt appointed by <hi>Thebit</hi> the Arabian, and very much advanced by the late learned <hi>Copernicus</hi> againſt the unſounder opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> in whoſe judgment it ſeemed as deceivable as to account from the wandring <hi>Saturn,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

                  <p>The preciſe Quantitie of this Year in Daies is determin'd of by all to bee 365, but the ſurplus of Hours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts hath verie much and vainly exerciſed the moſt curious.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Eclipſes.</head>
                     <p>EClipſ is more properly ſaid of the Moon then of the Sun. The Eclipſ of the Moon is cauſſed by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Earth. The Eclipſ of the Sun by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58600:184"/> of the Moon, therefore the Sun cannot bee Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but when hee is in Conjunction with the Moon; nor the Moon, but when ſhee is in oppoſition to the Sun: yet neither do the Eclipſes com to paſs, as often as theſe Lights oppoſe or conjoin; for then they ſhould bee Monethlie: Onely that Conjunction or Oppoſition maketh an Eclipſ which is Diametral; that is, when the center of the Earth and the centers of both the Luminaries ſhall bee in the ſame line, which hapneth to bee there onely, where the Moon's Eccentrick cutteth the Sun's in that Line, which is therefore called the Ecliptick. This interſection is (as needs it muſt) but in two places, called by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the <hi>Nodi,</hi> one aſſcending, the other deſcending. The Arabians term them the Dragon's Head and Tail, from the faſhion of the Interſections as they imagine it. But neither do theſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections keep one certain place, but moving make a Circle of 18 Years, ſo that the Eclipſ of the Moon which ſhall fall out the tenth of <hi>December</hi> next, in the 20 deg. of Gemini, ſhall 18 Years hence com to paſs in the ſame Sign again.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Eclipſes beeing Periodical, the begining of the World ſuppoſed, the Aſtronomer by Calculation can attein to anie, and all that ever have been by the ſame Rules, by which hee foretelleth thoſe that ſhall bee ſo, that if anie where in Storie this Character ſhall occurr, nothing can more aſſure the Time.</p>
                     <p>Let Inſtance bee made in the Begining of the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the appointment whereof dependeth upon the Battel at <hi>Arbela,</hi> or (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> correcteth) at <hi>Gaugamele.</hi> Eleven daies (ſaith the ſame Autor) before this fight an Eclipſ of the Moon was ſeen. 'Twas the ſecond hour of the Night, ſaith <hi>Plinie,</hi> the Moon then riſing in <hi>Sicilie.</hi> Aſtronomical calculation demonſtrateth that this Eclipſ (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) could not fall out but in the ſecond Year of the 112 Olympiad, which was the 3619 of the World, the Sun beeing then in the 24 deg. of Virgo. And therefore that God in <hi>Cicero</hi> miſtook the courſ of the Stars, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged,<note place="margin">Cic. de. Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> that if the Moon ſhould bee Eclips'd in Leo, a little before the Sun's riſe, the Victorie ſhould fall on <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58600:184"/> ſide. So indeed it did, but neither was the Moon then in Leo, nor the Sun in the Eaſt.<note place="margin">De Emend. Temp. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Chronolog. Bunting. fol. <hi>126.</hi>
                        </note> For ſuch is the aſſurance of this Character, that though the Aſtronomer learn of the Hiſtorian, that there was an Eclipſ; yet where, and oft-times when it was, the Hiſtorian might learn of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Dio</hi> ſet down that there was an Eclipſ of the Sun a little before the death of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> but by a Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Aſtronomical, the Eclipſ was not of the Sun but of the Moon, nor was it a little before, but a little after his death.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reporteth, that in his time (about the Year of Chriſt 393) ſo terrible a darkneſs overſhadowed the earth <hi>(obſcurato ſole)</hi> that everie man thought the World was at an end. <hi>Nos ſcindimus Eccleſiam</hi> (ſaith hee to <hi>Pammachius) qui ante paucos menſes, circa dies Pentecoſtes, cum obſcurato Sole omnis Mundus jam jámque venturum Judicem formidaret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Aſtronomers finde that there could bee no Eclipſ of the Sun then, nor near about that time; but in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they anſwer, that the Interpoſition was made by ſom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual exhalations, of that opacitie, which might intercept the Sun's light, in as great a meaſure as if the Moon had com between; Such an one was that Eclipſ (as ſom Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians miſcal it) which was ſeen ſo often in one Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ceſar's</hi> death, and that of the Year 798, the Sun bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo dark for 18 daies together, <hi>ut naves in mari aberrarent,</hi>

                        </note> which was a greater Eclipſ then the Moon could make.</p>
                     <p>Yet neither is it here to bee diſſembled that the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themſelvs do not alwaies agree about this infallible Character, for <hi>Moller</hi> findeth out, by his <hi>Friſian</hi> Tables, manie Eclipſes which cannot bee attein'd unto by the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenick Tables, or thoſe of the King <hi>Alphonſus, &amp;c.</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this, wee are to laie an imputation upon their Tables, as beeing not all exacted from the ſame Hypotheſes, or not performed with like elaborate erection: Or otherwiſe wee are to ſaie (ſuppoſing the Tables to bee exact) that ſom er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was committed in the calculation of the Eclipſ. And in this caſe wee are to guid our ſelvs by the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Art. For what if <hi>Moller</hi> ſaie that the Year of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58600:185"/> 
                        <hi>Ceſar Auguſtus</hi> his diſeaſ cannot bee demonſtrated by the Eclipſ of the Moon in the begining of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> becauſ the Moon was Eclipſed both the Year before and after. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus Calviſius</hi> may ſatisfie, that neither of thoſe could bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as this was, and whereas the one of thoſe was ſeen at 7, the other at 8 of the Clock at night, this was ſeen at 5 in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>And therefore all this notwithſtanding, the Character is to bee accounted excellent and of ſingular importance, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, not ignorant of, appointed <hi>Caliſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> at the ſiege of Babylon, to reſerv with all poſſible care the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or Aſtronomical calculations of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as <hi>Simplicius</hi> relateth. And the care was taken, yet none of theſe obſervations (though known to bee very manie) could eſcape the injurie of time, ſave onely three Eclipſes, which came to <hi>Ptolomie</hi>'s hands, unto which, himſelf added three more of his own obſervation, ſerving very much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Hiſtorical Truth, though this bee but a ſmall number, in compariſon of thoſe manie which the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here and there have committed to Memorie; for indeed wee are not for this matter, much leſs beholden to ignorance then to knowledg. Wee know when it was that a Romane General durſt not give Battel for fear of an Eclipſ: and that of the Moon in the begining of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">Tacitus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> can tel us, affrightned the mutinous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into order and accord: And 'tis not long ſince the Conqueror of the Indies perſuaded the Natives, that hee had complained of them to their Moon, and that ſuch a daie the God ſhould frown upon them, which was nothing elſ but an Eclipſ, which hee had found out in his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack.</p>
                     <p>However this ignorant Admiration was an occaſion to the Men of thoſe daies, not to leav ſo ſtrange an Accident, as an Eclipſ out of their Storie, eſpecially if it happened to bee great, or concurring with anie notable deſign: little aiming at that which the reach of thoſe daies hath brought to paſs upon them, which by turning over the leavs of that celeſtial volume, recovereth their Eclipſes again; and by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58600:185"/> application of this Character, maketh as ſure of the time propoſed, as if it had been written in Heaven.</p>

                     <p>THe diviſion of the Year into 52 Weeks, becauſ it ſetteth off one daie ſupernumerarie, maketh an alteration in all the reſt; ſo that the daies of the Week (which uſe to bee aſſigned by the letters of the Alphabet) fall not alike in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years; but Sundaie this Year, muſt fall out upon the next Year's Mondaie, and ſo forwards till ſeven Years; and (becauſ the Biſſextile ſuperaddeth another daie everie fourth Year) till four times ſeven, that is twentie eight Years bee gon about. This Revolution is called the Cycle of the Sun taking name from Sundaie, the Letter whereof (called therefore Dominical) it appointeth for everie year. It is found by adding nine (for ſo far the Circle was then gon about) to the Year of our Lord, and dividing the whole by 28. So to the year following 1639, if 9 bee added, the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus factus</hi> will bee 1648, which divided by 28 leaveth 24 for the Cycle of the Sun.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>COnjunctio ſuperiorum</hi> is not the ſame thing now as of old. The antient Aſtrologers called no Conjunction great but that of <hi>trium Superiorum,</hi> when <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> met altogether. But the later finding the effects of the two conjoined more ſtrong and prevailing then of the three; have given the name of a great Conjunction onely to that of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two ſuperior Planets finiſhing their Circles in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal time, they make three Conjunctions in the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. The twelv Signs in Aſtrologie are divided into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58600:187"/> four Trigons, or Triplicities, each denominated from the connatural Element; and ſo they are three Fierie, three Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, three Waterie, and three Earthie. Nineteen years, and ſom odd daies and hours gon about, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> meet together in Signs of the ſame Triplicitie: 198 years gon about they meet in ſigns of ſeveral Triplicitie, but not altogether in complying: 794 years and 214 daies gon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout they meet in Signs of contrarie Triplicitie. The firſt of theſe is called <hi>Conjunctio Minor;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Media.</hi> This latter <hi>Magna,</hi> the great Conjunction, when <hi>Saturn</hi> joineth force with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the fierie Trigon or Triplicitie, which though it happen in 794 years, and 214 daies, yet it uſeth to bee accounted by the <hi>Numerus rotundus</hi> of 800.</p>
                     <p>By theſe Conjunctions, Cardinal <hi>Aliac</hi> undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the whole State of Chronologie, and make infallible demonſtration of the years of the World.</p>
                     <p>To bring this about, hee firſt of all ſuppoſed out of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumazar</hi> the figure of Heaven when the World began: That the Horoſcope was in the ſeventh of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and that the Sun was in the 19 of Aries, the reſt of the Planets accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>This taken for granted, hee brought himſelf to that firſt and great Conjunction, which falling out in the waterie Triplicitie, inſinuated ſuch an influence into the Inferior bodies, as brought upon the World that univerſal Deluge, as <hi>Aoniar,</hi> and <hi>Albumazar</hi> delivered out of their Antients. By this Conjunction hee aſſigned 2242 years for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val betwixt the Flood, and the begining of things, but which was neither true in it ſelf, nor following his own Principles. And therefore wee may imagine what Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hee was likely to make, whoſe foundation was not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appointed: though otherwiſe a great Conjunction may bee ſet down among the Characters of Chronologie; but rather to aſſure, then to finde out the moments of time; and more concerning that which is to com, then thoſe which are gon and paſt.</p>

Theſe ſeven years ſeven times told made 49 years, and the 50 was their Jubile, ſo called from <hi>Jobel,</hi> which, as ſom Rabbins interpret, is as much in Arabick, as Aries in Latine;<note place="margin">Talmud. in Roſh. Haſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> for ſo <hi>Aquiba</hi> one of their Doctors reporteth, that when hee travelled in Arabia hee heard the people call a Ram <hi>Jobel.</hi> Add hereunto that when the Jubile came, a great ſound of Trumpets was to bee made through all Iſraël in ſign of the Remiſſions, and theſe Trumpets, they ſaie, were made of Rams horns. But this, though favoured alſo by the Chaldie Paraphraſe, yet ſoundeth not ſo credibly to the Learned,<note place="margin">Targum in Joſu. <hi>6.</hi> v. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> eſpecially the known Arabick not acknowledging that word.

                     <p>The Jubiles though by Inſtitution begining at the 2500 year from the Creätion, yet are Proleptically reckoned from the begining of the world; which alſo was conſidered by the Autor, for the firſt year of <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt Jubile, was the laſt of the 51 Jubile from the Worlds Creätion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the Autumn where the Jubiles begin.</p>
                     <p>If it bee ſaid that ſuch or ſuch a thing was don in a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year, 'tis a very good Character in the Jewiſh Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an ordinarie opinion that <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> was the ſame with that <hi>Nabopolaſſar</hi> in the Canon of <hi>Ptolomie;</hi> But

'tis certain out of the Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> that the 18. year of <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was a Sabbatical year, and it may bee demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated out of the <hi>Almagiſt,</hi> that the 18 of <hi>Nabopolaſſar</hi> was not, therefore they were not the ſame by this Character.</p>
                     <p>But in accounting the Sabbatical years, this rule is to bee obſerved, that the ſame year which endeth one Jubile, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the next, or otherwiſe the Scripture it ſelf would bee charged with error.

                     <p>THe Indictions, as the Circles of the Sun and Moon are verie aſſuring Characters even by themſelvs, <hi>ſed eorum fallax eſt uſus niſi quaedam ex illis Periodus inſtituatur,</hi> but of much greater certaintie, ſaith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> if brought into a Circle or period; which was alſo conſidered by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Abbat, who therefore (taking ſom example from <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Aquitanus</hi>) multiplied the Cycle of the Moon into the Cycle of the Sun, that is 19 into 28, which made up 532 years, and ſo it was called the <hi>Cyclus Magnus,</hi> and from the Autor, <hi>Dionyſianus.</hi> Unto this the great <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the third Character of Indictions, the Revolution whereof hee multiplied into the other two, that is 532 by 15, and the whole Circle was 7980: and this is that <hi>magna Periodus Juliana Scaligeri; Juliana,</hi> from the <hi>Julian</hi> form, by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58600:190"/> which it meaſureth, and <hi>Scaligeri,</hi> from the laſt Hand.</p>
                     <p>The admirable condition of this Period is to diſtinguiſh everie year within the whole Circle, by a ſeveral certain Character: for, as in that of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> Let the Cycle of the Sun bee 2, and the Moon 3, or whatſoever, in what year ſoever; the ſame never had, nor never again could fall out within the ſpace of time: ſo in this of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> let the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Moon bee 5, that of the Sun 23. Let the Indicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee 6, as it falleth out this preſent year 1638. I ſaie the ſame Characters ſhall not again concurr till the revolution of 7980 years bee gon about.</p>
                     <p>This Period the Autor fixed in the <hi>Tohu,</hi> or eternal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os of the World, 764 <hi>Julian</hi> years before the moſt reputed time of Creätion, ſo that the Circle is not yet out, but ſhall bee the 3267 of the Incarnation.</p>
                     <p>This hee did, that hee might comprehend all, and more then ever was don, all <hi>Aera's, Epoche's</hi> and Terms in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie, and in ſpecial, that of <hi>Orbis Conditi,</hi> which, through varietie of opinion, was ſo inconſtantly diſpos'd of, that Chronologers knew not where to fix themſelvs: then alſo that hee might give ſom account for the Heroïcal times of thoſe <hi>Egyptian Dynaſts</hi> pretending Antiquitie manie years further back into the Chaos, then the <hi>Moſaïcal</hi>

                     <p>All this and more hee hath brought to paſs by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Period, which bringing the three Characters to a concurrence yearly, diſtinct and ſeveral, muſt needs deliver up a moſt infallible account of time.</p>
                     <p>To advance the opinion of their concurrence, let them firſt bee ſingly conſidered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith at the end of his Antiquities, that hee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that work in the thirteenth year of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and 56 of his own age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> demonſtrateth by the Circle of the Moon, that either hee ſaith not true of the thirteenth of the Emperor, or elſ himſelf was one year elder.<note place="margin">De Emend. Temp. l. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>476.</hi>
                        </note> Again,</p>
                     <p>The Chronologers are not a little aſhamed that they ſhould not bee able to ſatisfie, as concerning ſo late and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58600:190"/> a Calamitie, as the ſiege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by <hi>Mahumed</hi> the ſecond: eſpecially recommended to poſteritie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the deep impreſſions of ſo vaſt a Miſerie, but alſo by ſom ſecret concourſ of Fatalitie, as beeing both built and loſt by a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the ſon of <hi>Helen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far they agree, that the Citie was taken either <hi>Anno</hi> 1452, or elſ 1453, <hi>poſt Ch. Nat.</hi> they agree alſo for the moſt part, that it was taken the 29 of <hi>Maie, feriâ</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarchical, as alſo the Political Hiſtorie ſet forth by <hi>Cruſius,</hi> equally affirm that the Citie was taken in the year, 1453. <hi>Chalcondyles</hi> and <hi>Hieromonachus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that it was the year before, but all agreeing that the daie was Tueſdaie, the 29. of <hi>Maie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſaie that the year 1452 had 5 for the Circle of the Sun, therefore the 29 of <hi>Maie</hi> could not that year fall upon Tueſdaie, but the daie before, therefore either the Citie was taken the year 1453, or elſ it was not taken the 29 of <hi>Maie;</hi> but they all agree that it was taken that daie, therefore it was taken that year, by the Circle of the Sun. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſtate of the Citie ſtood 425 years longer then <hi>Valens</hi> the Aſtrologer foretold, who beeing demanded concerning the fate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> erected the Figure of Heaven for the Nativitie thereof. The Horoſcope was Cancer. Having conſidered the Stars hee gave this Judgment, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould live to the age of 696 years, but thoſe are paſt and gon, ſaith <hi>Zonaras,</hi> except hee would bee meant of the flouriſhing ſtate, for otherwiſe hee was deceived.</p>

Marcellinus</hi> noteth this Conſulſhip with <hi>Indictione tertiâ,</hi> therefore it was in the year of Chriſt 405. but the Cycle of the Sun for this year was 22, therefore the 7 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>November</hi> could not fall out upon Fridaie, but the

Therefore the year before the ſixth Conſulſhip of <hi>Honorius</hi> was the year of Chriſt 403, therefore the ſixth Conſulſhip of <hi>Honorius</hi> was the year 404; and therefore the ſecond of <hi>Stilico</hi> was 405. In this demonſtration the three Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters all concurr, but not periodically, yet to the making up of a ſtrange Truth; for by this it will follow, that hee which inſcrib'd the Tomb did not know the Conſul's name, though hee lived at the ſame time. <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore. <hi>Quàm barbari ſunt &amp; impuri</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>qui doctrinam Cyclorum irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

                     <p>Thus much aſſurance wee can make to our ſelvs from the ſeveral abilities of each Character, but which if they meet together in this Period, ſet ſuch a mark upon the time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as maketh it to bee known from anie other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, within the duration of the world, or the whole Circle at leaſt. <hi>Artificioſiſſima Periodus!</hi> as <hi>Helvicus</hi> admireth, with manie others: ſo that the Autor needed not to break forth into his <hi>Nos qui eam excogitavimus periodum hanc ſatìs laudare non poſſumus.

                        <hi>Salian</hi> (otherwiſe a great Annaliſt) looſeth a Chapter or two in the diſparagement of this Period, as hee exſpected it ſhould redound, but it falleth out unto his own. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdneſs of his exceptions betraie him thus far, that hee could have no juſter cauſ why to expoſe this period, then that himſelf had been ſo unfortunate as to build his Annals upon a leſs during foundation. But of what accompliſhment this Period is, I think wee may beſt of all bee judg'd by <hi>Petavius,</hi> the moſt open mouth againſt that great reſtorer of Chronologie. This <hi>Petavius</hi> ſaith, that there is not one thing in that whole Book, <hi>De Emendatione temporum,</hi> not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to juſt reproof, this onely period excepted, then which hee confeſſeth to know nothing more important for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58600:191"/> of Chronologie: and therefore earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth it unto general practice, aſſuring all men that by this means, the moſt inſuperable confuſions of time may bee reduc'd to order, with moſt incredible eaſ and effect.</p>

                     <p>Som (but moſt unreaſonably) derive the word from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> one of the names of <hi>Juno,</hi> ſo <hi>Garcios Loiſa</hi> out of <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare,</hi> as hee thinketh; others from the ſame word, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth dominion, ſo they force it; they ſhould rather have conſidered that <hi>Hera</hi> in the Spaniſh tongue ſignifieth time, though from a Gothick Original, from whence our Saxons had their <hi>gere,</hi> or year, as wee now call it. And this may ſeem to bear ſom relation to the word, eſpecially for that <hi>Aera</hi> is oftentimes uſed for <hi>Annus</hi> in <hi>Iſidore's</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle and elſwhere. Sir <hi>Henrie Spelman</hi>'s Gloſſarie may bee ſeen in this word. <hi>Scaliger, Petavius, Calviſius</hi> and others confirm, that <hi>Era</hi> in old Latine ſignified as much as <hi>Numerus,</hi> and 'tis manifeſt enough out of <hi>Nonius Fauſtus Regienſis,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf; and this they hold to bee the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie derivation of the word, if it bee, yet hee that firſt obſerved it was <hi>Reſendius</hi> a Spaniard, in an Epiſtle to a friend of his, who required his Opinion concerning the <hi>Aera Hiſpanica.</hi>

                     <p>But becauſ this <hi>Etymon</hi> doth no waie intimate why that uſe of the word ſhould bee peculiarly taken up among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (except it were true which <hi>Scaliger</hi> conſidered that it was in uſe elſwhere, but againſt which <hi>Petavius</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a probable reaſon) the Notation in the Gloſſarie would rather bee taken, and ſo it may bee a word of the Gothick derivation, tranſlated thence to the Spaniſh uſe, and properly ſaid of their <hi>Epoche,</hi> but now the common name of all others.</p>

                     <p>If the Queſtion were asked indefinitely, whether the World began in the Spring, the Summer, the Winter or the Autumn, the anſwer muſt bee, That it began in all.

                     <p>'Tis agreed upon by all, that it began in ſom Cardinal point; that is, that the Motions began from the Eaſtern Angle of the Holie-Land, the Solſtitial or Aequinoctial points one or other of them aſſcending in the Horoſcope.

                     <p>Yet <hi>Christman</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> themſelvs found it an eaſier matter to tell who <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> was not, then who hee was. It ſeemed to <hi>Chriſtman,</hi> that hee might bee the ſame with <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladan</hi> the father of <hi>Merodach,</hi> or at leaſt that hee was a King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe own name was unknown, <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Name of that Kingdom, as hee thinketh, and common to them all. <hi>Scaliger</hi> putteth this together, and aſſuring himſelf that <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> was the ſame with <hi>Beladan,</hi> maketh no doubt but that was the name of the King, this of the man.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58600:194"/> accounted their Celeſtial Calculations.

But for a more certain demonſtration of the time, three Lunar Eclipſes noted by <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> are ſet down by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageſt.</hi> The firſt was ſeen at <hi>Alexandria</hi> the 16 daie of <hi>Meſori,</hi> in the 547 year of <hi>Nabonaſſar.</hi> This Eclipſ by the <hi>Julian</hi> Calculation and Tables of <hi>Calviſius,</hi> fell out upon Fridaie the 22 of <hi>September,</hi> at 7 of the Clock in the afternoon, and 20 minutes; the Sun then beeing in the 26 of Virgo. It was the Year 4513 of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, that is the 3749 from the Worlds Creätion, out of which if wee deduct the 547 years of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> the remainder will bee 3203, the year of the Worlds Creätion, wherein this <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed; The daie as the King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and before him the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Almagest</hi> have delivered, was <hi>Dies Thoth,</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii;</hi> anſwering to the 26 of the Julian <hi>Februarie,</hi> begining (ſo <hi>Ptolomie</hi>) at high noon, the Sun then entring into Piſces, and the Moon, beeing in the 11 degree and 22 minutes of Taurus. And the ſame concluſion will follow from the two other Eclipſes, reduced in like manner to our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                     <p>And to put all out of doubt, <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> ſaith that the 986 Year of <hi>Nobonaſſar</hi> was the 238 of Chriſt, but that was the 4951 of the Julian Period. Therefore <hi>Nabonaſsar's Aera</hi> began in the 3967 year of the ſame Period, which was the 3203 Year from the World's Creätion. So that the <hi>Aera</hi> is undoubtedly aſſured.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Aera</hi> ſtill accounteth by <hi>Epyptian</hi> years, which are therefore called <hi>Anni Nabonaſſarei,</hi> and becauſ it began upon Wedneſdaie, the firſt daie of their firſt Moneth, which (as the daie it ſelf) they hold holie to <hi>Thoth</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi>) uſeth to bee called <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi>'s <hi>Thoth.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Aera of the Olympiads.</head>
                     <p>THe Olympick Games were inſtituted for the exerciſe of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth, by <hi>Hercules</hi> (as the Tradition go's) to the honor of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> near unto whoſe Temple they were perform'd in the Olympian field. The Exerciſe was called <hi>Pentathlon,</hi> or <hi>Quinquertium,</hi> from the fivefold kinde. The Victor was crowned with an Olive, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly carried in a Chariot into his own Citie, and, which is to the purpoſe, his name was publickly recorded.</p>
                     <p>The time was (as onely <hi>Pindar</hi> hath revealed) at the full Moon which followed the Summer Solſtice. They were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated everie fifth year; and the Interval was called an Olympiad, conſiſting of 4 Julian years, and the odd Biſſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile daie, which was the cauſ, as ſom think, why this form of year was firſt introduced.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Celebration by <hi>Hercules</hi> vaniſhing in the Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, grew to bee leſs famous then the reſtitution by <hi>Iphitus,</hi> whereof ſo much more notice hath been taken then of the other, that this which was manie years after, is yet account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the firſt Olympiad. The time or <hi>Aera</hi> whereof is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Character of that extraordinarie Eclipſ, which the Sun ſuffered with our Saviour, noted by <hi>Phlegon</hi> to have happened in the 202 Olympiad, which multiplied by four maketh 808 years, between the firſt Olympiad, and the Paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides that, <hi>Thucydides</hi> reporteth that in the firſt year of the <hi>Peloponneſiack</hi> War, on a ſummer's daie in the afternoon, there hapned an Eclipſ of the Sun, ſo great an one, as that the Stars appeared. This Eclipſ, by Aſtronomical Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is found to bee the ſecond daie of <hi>Julie,</hi> in the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt 463, at which time (as <hi>Cruſius</hi> calculateth) the Sun was Eclipſed in the 6 of Leo, half an hour after 5 in the afternoon, the digits of the Eclipſ were 9, and four third parts, therefore almoſt one fourth part of the Sun was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58600:195"/> reſpecting the Horizon of <hi>Athens,</hi> but in <hi>Thrace</hi> the Eclipſ was well nigh total; ſo that the Stars were ſeen.</p>
                     <p>This therefore was that Eclipſ which <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith was ſeen in the firſt year of the <hi>Peloponneſiack</hi> war.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth Year of the ſame War, the ſame Autor ſaith that <hi>Donius Rhodius</hi> wan the Prize in the Olympicks, and this was the fourth year of the 87 Olympiad, and that was the 460 year before Chriſt. If therefore the 87 Olympiads bee multiplied by 4, they becom 348 Julian years, which if they bee added to 460, the total will bee as before, 808 years, or the 202 Olympiad before the Paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Again <hi>Thucydides</hi> reporteth, that in the 19 year of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſiack</hi> War, the Moon was Eclipſed, and this was as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> relateth in the fourth year of the 91 Olympiad. That Eclipſ of the Moon, as <hi>Cruſius</hi> calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, fell out upon the 27 daie of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the 445 year before the Paſſion of Chriſt. If therefore 90 Olympiads bee multiplied by 4, they make up 360 Julian years, to which alſo muſt bee added the three firſt years of the 91 Olympiad, and then they are 363, which added to 445, make up 808 years before the Paſſion of our Saviour, which falleth with the 3173 year of the World, and is the <hi>Aera</hi> of the Olympiads.</p>

                     <p>This Epilogiſm was found out by <hi>Tarutius</hi> (or as hee is more rightly called <hi>(Taruntius Firmanus,</hi> a great Aſtrologer of thoſe daies, who at the ſolicitation of <hi>Varro</hi> caſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of <hi>Rome;</hi> which to recover, hee firſt of all tried for the Founders Horoſcope.

That hee was born the one and twentieth of the Moneth <hi>Thoth,</hi> about the Sun riſing. That the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> was laied the ninth daie of <hi>Pharmuth</hi> between two and three a clock in the morning, the Moon beeing then in <hi>Jugo.</hi> So the Aſtrologer.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe the Tradition was (which alſo <hi>Taruns</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) that the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> was laid in the third year of the ſixth Olympiad, the Sun and Moon then bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58600:196"/> in an Ecliptical conjunction, which defection was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Antimachus</hi> the <hi>Teïan</hi> Poet.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt Eclipſ, as his Tables (which are ſaid to bee thoſe of <hi>Hipparchus</hi>) directed him, it fell out in the firſt year of the ſecond Olympiad, upon the 23 daie of the Moneth <hi>Choeac,</hi> which anſwereth to the 24 of June at three a clock in the morning. Yet according to <hi>Tyche, Ptolomie</hi>'s, and the King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> their Tables, the latitude was then ſo great that there could bee no Eclipſ at that time. So <hi>Sethus Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> and others. <hi>Nicolas Muller</hi> pretended, that this Eclipſ could not bee found out by the <hi>Prutenick</hi> Tables, but by the <hi>Friſian,</hi> which hee was then about (his own and more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate) hee promiſeth to account for it. <hi>Calviſius</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the <hi>Prutenick</hi> Tables according to <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes were moſt exactly performed, and that hee doubted <hi>Muller</hi> could not ſtand to his word. Yet ſince that <hi>Muller</hi> hath calculated this Eclipſ, and found it to bee by his <hi>Friſian</hi> Tables, according as the Aſtrologer ſet down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henrie Bunting</hi> findeth it in the ſecond year of the ſecond Olympiad, one year later then the <hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> And this may ſeem to bee nothing out of the waie. For <hi>Dionyſius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſsius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Romulus</hi> as hee came not into the world, ſo hee went not out without an Eclipſ. Now <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> reigned 37 years, at which verie time the Sun was Eclipſed, upon Saturdaie the 26 of <hi>Maie</hi> about 7 of the clock in the afternoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sun then ſetting at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the greateſt abſurditie <hi>Calviſius</hi> could finde in this was, that it ſetteth off but 18 years for the age of <hi>Romulus</hi> at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Rome;</hi> which as hee think's could not make him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enough for the importance of this undertaking; but conſidering all other circumſtances agree ſo well, the Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is unjuſt enough.</p>
                     <p>For the other Eclipſ pretended to bee at the Foundation of the Citie. <hi>Nicolas Muller</hi> findeth that alſo in his <hi>Friſian</hi> tables, yet confeſſeth it could not bee ſeen at <hi>Rome;</hi> but in <hi>Aſia</hi> 'twas viſible hee ſaith, and ſo might bee known to <hi>Antimachus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this maketh ſomthing for the Aſtrologer, who (as <hi>Cicero</hi> citeth him) found the Moon at the Foundation in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58600:196"/> 
                        <hi>Jugo,</hi> that is, as <hi>Solin</hi> may ſeem to interpret it, in <hi>Libra;</hi> the rather, becauſ the Poët <hi>Manilius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Rome</hi> was built in <hi>Libra.</hi> So <hi>Petavius:</hi> but <hi>Solinus</hi> (though hee knew not what hee ſaid) yet ſaith too, That the Sun was then in <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is demonſtrated by <hi>Bunting,</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that it was in the twentieth degree; and therefore the more learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> and his <hi>Calviſius</hi> interpret the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers in <hi>Jugo,</hi> to bee the ſame which is now ſaid in <hi>Nodo,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that the Sun and Moon were then in Conjunction, as <hi>Muller</hi> ſaith well, and that the Sun was <hi>intra terminos Eclipticos,</hi> within the Ecliptick terms at <hi>Rome,</hi> but not ſo far as to make the defection viſible in that Horizon.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever the Aſtrologer according to his Calculation ſet down that <hi>Rome</hi> was built in the third year of the ſixth Olympiad, which <hi>Terence Varro</hi> took for his reſolution; and ſo reckoned from the Regifugium to the <hi>Palilia</hi> 244 years; <hi>Marcus Cicero, Titus Pomponius Atticus</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Auguſtus</hi> approving the Epilogiſms, and beſides them <hi>Plutarch, Plinie, Paterculus</hi> and others, and 'twas the received opinion; and is infallibly demonſtrated in <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie, by eight ſeveral celeſtial Characters or Eclipſes, which calculated to <hi>Nabonaſſar's Aera</hi> fall even with the Aſtrologer. To ſay nothing of <hi>Cruſius,</hi> who hath don ſomthing to the ſame purpoſe, or <hi>Peter Appian,</hi> who evinceth the ſame (I ſaie not how truely) out of the Figure of the Heavens, which <hi>Turnus</hi> found (but as <hi>Julius Solinus</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it) at the laying of the Foundation, <hi>Verrius Flaccus</hi> in the <hi>Faſti Capitolini</hi> ſetteth down <hi>Rome</hi> built in the fourth year of the ſixth Olympiad, one year later; and the Canons of <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> in the firſt year of the ſeventh Olympiad one year more, or rather but one in all; for the Regiſters of the Capitol agree with <hi>Cato,</hi> and hee differeth nothing from <hi>Varro,</hi> if <hi>Calviſius</hi> may bee Judge.</p>

                     <p>THis <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed by the Angel <hi>Gabriel, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Weeks</hi> (ſaith hee to the Prophet) <hi>are determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ</hi> 24. <hi>Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandment, to restore and build Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall bee ſeven Weeks, and threeſcore and two Weeks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And after threeſcore and two Weeks ſhall Meſſiah bee cut off, but not for himſelf; and the people of the Prince that ſhall com ſhall deſtroy the Citie and the Sanctuarie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And hee ſhall confirm the Covenant with manie for one Week, and in the midſt of the Week hee ſhall cauſ the Sacrifice and the Oblation to ceaſ, and for the overſpreading of abominations hee ſhall make it deſolate, even until the conſummation, &amp;c.</hi> So the Angel.</p>
                     <p>The Weeks are to bee underſtood not of daies, but Years; and thoſe not of the Moon, but the Sun; and ſo 70 by 7 is 490 years, from the time of the going forth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment &amp;c. unto the Abomination of deſolation. But where to begin or end this Epilogiſm, is the <hi>vexata Quaeſtio,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> cal's it, a queſtion that hath endured the greateſt controverſie, involved with circumſtances of ſuch notable intricacie, that a Scholar of verie great parts ('tis reported by one that knew the man) fell mad with ſtudying how to make this good.</p>
                     <p>Som reckon the Epilogiſm from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> others from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> and ſom from the ſeventh, others from the 20 of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> accordingly ending the Weeks, ſom at the profanation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> others at the deſtruction of the Temple by <hi>Pompey,</hi> or that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> or elſ at the Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>The trueſt of the falſ, is that which begineth at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> and endeth in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58600:197"/> Paſſion: for this maketh a good account of the years. It was the opinion of the learned <hi>Bunting, Funccius,</hi> &amp;c. but that which I perceiv to bee reſted upon, is the judgment of <hi>Scaliger</hi> followed by <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and this begineth the Epilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm at the ſecond year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and determineth it in the final deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus.</hi> For the Angel ſaith expreſly, that <hi>after ſeven Weeks and ſixtie two weeks, the Meſſiah beeing cut off, the holie Citie ſhall bee deſtroied &amp;c. and that in the middle of the ſeventieth week the Sacrifice and Oblation ſhall ceaſ, and for an overſpreading of abomination,</hi> &amp;c. which is plainly called by our Saviour, <hi>the abomination of deſolation, ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet &amp;c.</hi> and therefore no queſtion, but the feventie Weeks are to end with the Holie Citie. Their begining was to bee from the time of the going forth of the Commandment, &amp;c. And this, though ſuch an one was given firſt by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and thirdly by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> yet moſt purpoſely from <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> in the ſecond year of his reign. The 13 year of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> is the 20 of the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſiack</hi> war by <hi>Thucydides</hi> that was the 92 Olympiad, and this was the 3538 from the Worlds Creätion, or 4302 of the Julian Period, therefore the 2 year of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> was the 4290 of the Julian Period, and that was the 3562 from the worlds Creätion. The Cycle of the Sun was 6 and the Moon 15. And the Interval is expreſsly 490 years. For the Holie Citie was deſtroyed in the ſeventieth year of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, which was the 4019 from the Worlds Creätion, and the 4783 of the Julian Period; the Cycle of the Sun was 23, and the Moon 14.</p>

                     <p>Therefore this <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed in the 4402 of the Julian Period, which was the 3638 from the world's Creätion; the Cycle of the Sun was 6, and the Moon 13. The <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed ſaith <hi>Scaliger</hi> (though <hi>Petavius</hi> will not yield it) by <hi>Calipus</hi> of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> who finding that <hi>Meton's ciclus decennovenalis</hi> exceeded the Moon's Revolution one qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of a daie, put four of theſe together, and detracting from thence one whole daie for the quadruple exceſs of hours, gave an exacter account of the Lunations then before.</p>

                     <p>So <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſtman,</hi> might bee called either for that his Empire was bipartite into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> (which is not altogether ſo true) or otherwiſe, for that hee joined the Eaſt and Weſt together with Conqueſts, holding as it were the two Hornes of the World in his Victorious hands.</p>

                     <p>The fourth year of the 22 Olympiad anſwereth to the 19 of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the 33 of the Nativitie, which was the 4745 of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and 3982 of the World, in the 78 <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> year, and 780 of <hi>Nabonaſſar;</hi> and becauſ it was <hi>feria ſexta,</hi> therefore it was the third daie of <hi>April,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the verie ſame daie a natural Eclipſ of the Moon in the 11 of <hi>Libra,</hi> which began at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at 5 of the clock and 49 minutes in the afternoon.

So the new Moon which they ſuppoſe to bee upon the ſecond of the fix daies, that is, if the Luminaries had then been, they call <hi>Novilunium Tohu,</hi> for that as yet there was neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
                     <p>The firſt example of Proleptical Time was given by the Greek Church, who in their Computations follow the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture of the Septuagint. Therefore their <hi>Aera Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Conditi</hi> is ſixed in 5500 year <hi>Ante Chriſtum Natum.</hi> Their more Artificial men, perceiving that this vaſt Epilogiſm was good for ſomwhat elſ, beſides the meaſuring of Times, applied it to the Characters, and they found that divided by 19 and 28, it gave the Circle of the Sun and Moon, but divided by 15 it gave not the true Indiction; therefore they added 8 to the ſumm, and ſo it became a Technical or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Period, comprehending the three Characters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ it ſuppoſed 8 years of the <hi>Tohu,</hi> it was Proleptical; but which the Times following not conſidering reckoned Hiſtorically, as if the <hi>Aera Orbis</hi> had then been fixed; but are thus to bee corrected.</p>

                     <p>The extremeſt varietie is that of the Greek and Hebrew Scripture, making a difference of two thouſand years; an occaſion juſtly taken by ſom equally to diſparage the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie either of the one or the other. For it cannot bee but that this Epilogiſm muſt bee detracted from the Hebrew, or ſuperadded to the Greek, there beeing no mean waie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. But certainly, the Hebrew (though I hold it not ſo everie waies incorrupt, as if not one jot or title of the ſame ſuffered the common fate of time) yet I believ it to bee the Original, and by the incredible diligence of the <hi>Maſora,</hi> ſubſervient to the greater providence of God, to retain more of it's own puritie, then anie other Scripture whatſoever; and therefore that it reſteth in the Greek Tranſlation, to account for this difference: yet neither do I think that choice Aſſemblie ſo neglected by God in a matter ſo importantly cared for by him, as to recede ſo fouly from their Original.</p>
                     <p>I rather caſt this corruption upon the dregs of Time, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring my ſelf that this impoſture was put upon us by the Helleniſts, thoſe among them who affected that antient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the Chiliaſts; the conceit whereof I affirm to bee the occaſion of this corruption.</p>

                     <p>That profane Hiſtorie maketh no certain account of Time before the Olympiads.</p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58600:205"/>
                     <p>That in the Romane affairs (a moſt important piece of Hiſtorie) the Conſulſhips are not regiſtred in the <hi>Faſti</hi> with that diſtinction and care as was neceſſarie, experience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath been made by the induſtrious examinations of <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> and <hi>Cuſpinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Hiſtorians themſelvs generally did not conſider ſo much the deſignation of Time, otherwiſe then with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their own <hi>Aera</hi>'s, which were but uncertainly fixt.</p>
                     <p>That manie of them wrote not the Hiſtorie of their own Times.</p>
                     <p>That ſom of them took libertie to relate thoſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, which others related excluſively.</p>
                     <p>That ſeveral Nations reckoned not by the ſame form of years. That all Nations not Chriſtian, affected an Opinion of greater Antiquitie then their own beginings, endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore to leav the Storie of their riſing as poſſibly uncertain to poſteritie, as in them laie. So the <hi>Egyptians</hi> tell us of Heroes paſt, who by their reckoning reigned long before the world was made; which they ſaie with as much credit, as the Indians tell us, that they have out-liv'd four Suns alreadie, and that this which wee have is the fifth from their begining: To ſaie nothing of <hi>Janbazar Tſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> and <hi>Roani,</hi> men that lived before <hi>Adam's</hi> time, as the book <hi>Heubattiſh</hi> make's report, and that one <hi>Sombaſher</hi> was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tutor.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt cauſ of all is for that Profeſſed Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers of our own times, ſuch as <hi>Funccius, Beroaldus, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholcer,</hi> nay <hi>Satian, Baronius, Torniellus,</hi> and <hi>Gordon</hi> themſelvs were altogether unacquainted with anie Artificial waie of this work, not knowing how to make application of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Civil Characters to the aſſuring of Times. One of the firſt who began to know what was to bee don in this matter, was the moſt learned, and perceiving <hi>Mercator,</hi> who Inſtituted a Chronologie by waie of Demonſtration Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical. To this begining, ſomthing by <hi>Crentzeim</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but verie much more by <hi>Bunting</hi> the Autor of a moſt elaborate Chronologie, demonſtrating by the Characters
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58600:205"/> of Eclipſes, the Sun and Moons Circles, and with Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of everie Eclipſ ſince the world began.</p>
                     <p>But this Art hath received greateſt perfection from that excellent work of <hi>Scaliger de Emendat. Temporum,</hi> upon whoſe grounds <hi>Calviſius</hi> hath erected a moſt incomparable Chronologie for demonſtration of time by Eclipfes, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Sun and Moon ſeverally applyed to everie year, yet wanting ſo much to accompliſhment as may ſeem to bee added by the incredible pains of <hi>Helvicus;</hi> who excelleth <hi>Calviſius</hi> (though otherwiſe excelled by him) in Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſmes infinitely added, and the application of the Julian Period, which why <hi>Sethus Calviſius</hi> ſhould not meaſure is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much to bee marvelled. Theſe two therefore put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up Chronologie everie waies abſolute, and brought to ſuch a perfection as needs not to bee added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; for though I doubt not, but that even thoſe alſo are ſomtimes failing, as for ſom other neceſſarie and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defects; ſo alſo for that they are not throughly advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whoſe Tables Aſtronomical they beſt and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely may follow. Yet I aſſure my ſelf the differences cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this is but verie ſmall and inſenſible, that it cannot bee much amended though never ſo much care ſhould bee taken, and that by tampering it may bee made much worſ, as by the learned, infinite and equally unprofitable pain of <hi>Petavius,</hi> is too well known. Therefore good it were, that Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie brought to this degree of complement, might exſpect no extremer hand, but beeing ſtampt with the impreſſion of ſom publick autoritie, might go currant in general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without farther clipping or defacing upon whatſoever ſpecious and pretending reformations.</p>

                     <hi>Monarchie,</hi> as the Philoſopher diſcourſeth in his Politicks, is the government of one man over manie. According to the degrees of this Principalitie, the word <hi>Monarchie,</hi> is equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; in the prime meaning intending <hi>The Lawful Abſolute Rule of ſom Prince, either Elected or Succeeding, exerciſing Dominion correſponding with the Law of Nature, and the Right of Nations.</hi> Thus His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſtie is a Monarch or ſole Governor within theſe his Realms.</p>
                  <p>In a wider and unjuſter ſenſ, A <hi>Monarchie</hi> is taken for <hi>The Peremptorie Autoritie of ſom Mightie Potentate, whoſe Right and Title for the moſt part is his Sword;</hi> or, if hee hee Succeed, 'tis in the Ambition and Tyrannie of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, by which hee uſurpeth power where hee pleaſeth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58600:208"/> ſtriking into the hearts of Men rather the fear then the love of him, whereby hee enforceth his unwilling Vaſſals to an unnatural Obedience. Thus the great Turk may bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Monarch; for in this ſenſ, though it ſeem to ſecure it ſelf under the protection of an acceptable name; yet a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie thus taken,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Hiſtorians take more notice of this later, becauſ the more notorious: of this kinde were thoſe 4 great Monarchies unto whoſe Kings, as to famous <hi>Epoches,</hi> the ſtragling and unbounded affairs of the World are orderly reduced.</p>
                  <p>In this number the Kingdom of <hi>Aſhur</hi> beareth a place, and the firſt; the Deſcription whereof wee have here underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

And becauſ the Opticks teach, that everie Opacous bodie projecteth his Shadow to a part directly oppoſite to the bodie luminous, therefore the Sun beeing either in the Northern or Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Signes, their ſhadowes are never directed to the South, but contrariwiſe: therefore they are <hi>Heteroſcii.</hi> Laſtly, they have the Pole Artick alwaies elevated, and the Antarctick alwaies hid.</p>

                     <p>It might bee added how theſe Nations applyed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to the reſt of the Planets, as to <hi>Venus</hi> that is <hi>Shar:</hi> in the honor of whom their Feaſts were celebrated by the ſame rites that the Romane <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> the ſervants ſitting down, and their maſters attending: So alſo wee might put in <hi>Chiun,</hi> whom ſom cal <hi>Saturn,</hi> but of theſe,<note place="margin">

In the interim, wee muſt content our ſelvs with what hath been ſaid, briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their religious politie. Their Civil cuſtoms ſhall now take their places.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Aſhur</hi> was aſſiſted in the Civil Government by a trebble Magiſtracie, choſen all out of the graveſt and moſt noble within the Realm; The firſt ſort were to look to the placing of their Virgins according to that manner which ſhall hereafter bee declared: as alſo to give judgment in Matters of Adulterie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond in matters of Theft: The third in the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Phyſitians theſe people have none, they being ſuch who cannot ſave anie man by their profeſſion, till they have loſt ſom by their practice. The cuſtom here was, that all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons ſhould bee conducted to the Market-place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58600:221"/> proviſion beeing made for their ſafetie there. The reaſon was, that all paſſengers by ſhould viſit them, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring out the nature of their diſeaſ, and giving counſel for the remedie out of profitable experience made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, either in themſelvs or ſom others, upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And to this purpoſe it was provided by a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Statute, that no man ſhould dare to paſs by the Market-place, till hee had made ſuch inquiſition as is aforeſaid. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod. in Clio. Strab. lib.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>In this Countrie, it was not in the power of a private man to beſtow his daughter in Mariage, but this was don by a publick Officer appointed for that purpoſe. The manner was thus.</p>
                     <p>Once everie year, all mariageable Virgins were brought by that officer into the Market-place, and there ſet to Sale; if they were beautiful, the faireſt to thoſe that gave moſt: when all the beſt were thus beſtowed, the Monie which was paied in for them, was given to the reſt which were not ſo comelie and meritorious in their beautie; everie one beeing ſupplied with a dowrie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to her want: By this means it came to paſs, that ſtill the Gentrie and moſt wealthie amongſt the Men had the faireſt among the Women, they beeing beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to buie them and to keep them. Contrarily, the Commons and poorer people,<note place="margin">Strabo. Herod. ibid.</note> who had not means to compaſs the beſt, had means given them to bee content with the worſt. A Law not ſo provident as plauſible, and however it fitted their Common wealth, it would bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie unapt for ours.</p>
                     <p>Here followeth a Cuſtom moſt deteſtable and unfit for anie. Everie woman throughout all the Countrie, was bound once in their lives to repair to the Temple of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and there to proſtitute their bodies to whomſoever, that would but throw down a certain piece of monie, were it leſs, or more; which monie was given to the Temple, and to the honor of the Goddeſs. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was thus. The Women ſate down in the Temple, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed one from another by little lines of Cord, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58600:221"/> hee that would might take awaie, or break, if the Woman ſeem'd to bee coie; and ſo take their Strumpet out of the Temple into a by-corner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The Epiſtle of <hi>Hieremie,</hi> (if that bee his which wee finde annexed to the Apocryphal <hi>Baruch</hi>) maketh mention of this horrible and impious practice.</p>

This <hi>George</hi> was learned but (in the opinion of <hi>Scaliger</hi>) a moſt ſevere Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and Cenſorious judg of <hi>Fuſebius Pamphilus,</hi> whoſe Chronologie hee tranſcribed and examined.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58600:234"/> waies; for if wee reſtore him his four Kings again hee himſelf will bee found ſubject to greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and more abound in Anachroniſms, then before.

And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they could not have been ſo diſpoſed of, as they are, without the <hi>Globe,</hi> if they had not been exact Lines. But Uſe will have it ſo, and wee muſt call them the <hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Horizontal Circles.</hi>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the Meridian without the Globe.</head>
                     <p>THe Braſs Meridian is divided into 4 equal Parts or Quadrants, and each of them ſubdivided into 90 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that is 360 for the whole Circle. The reaſon why this Circle is not divided into 360 Degrees throughout, but ſtill ſtopping at the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and then again begining 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. is, becauſ the Uſes of this <hi>Meridian,</hi> ſo far as in Degrees they are concern'd, require not above that Number. As for an Example: One uſe of the <hi>Meridian</hi> is to ſhew the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole,</hi> but the <hi>Pole</hi> cannot bee elevated above 90 Degrees. Another is to ſhew the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> or Diſtance of a Place from the <hi>Equator,</hi> which alſo can never exceed the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the Circle; for no Place can bee further diſtant from the <hi>Equator</hi> then the <hi>Pole,</hi> which is juſt that Number of 90 Degrees.</p>
                     <p>Upon one of the North Quadrants of this <hi>Meridian,</hi> of ſom <hi>Great Globes,</hi> the <hi>Climes</hi> are ſet to the ſeveral Degrees of <hi>Latitude;</hi> and the Length of the longeſt Daie under the ſeveral <hi>Climes:</hi> which (if the Geographers would think ſo) might very fitly bee placed on the <hi>Leſſer Globe</hi>'s; for it were but dividing a Quadrant of the wrong ſide of the <hi>Meridian</hi> into 90 Degrees, and there would be room enough. In ſom other <hi>Globes</hi> the Climes are caſt into a Table, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured upon ſom void ſpace of the <hi>Globe.</hi> But the Diviſion upon a Quadrant of the <hi>Meridian,</hi> is much more artificial, as hereafter ſhall bee underſtood. And the reaſon why a North Quadrant onely need to bee divided, is, becauſ for the <hi>Climes</hi> of the Southern <hi>Latitude</hi> the reaſon is the ſame. And the reaſon why the Diviſion is made upon a North Quadrant rather then the South, is, becauſ our <hi>Globes</hi> are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58600:248"/> fitted for our Selvs, and all our ſhare of the Earth lieth in the North <hi>Latitude.</hi>

                     <head>Of the Axel and Poles of the Globe and of the Hour Circle.</head>
                     <p>FRom the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Ends of this <hi>Meridian</hi> a ſtrong <hi>Wyer</hi> of Braſs or Iron is drawn, or ſuppoſed to bee drawn (for the Artificers do not alwaies draw it quite through) by the Center of the <hi>Globe</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Axel</hi> of the Earth. The North End whereof ſtandeth for the <hi>North,</hi> the South End for the <hi>South Pole</hi> of the Earth. Upon the North End, a ſmall Circle of Braſs is ſet, and divided into two equal parts, and each of them into twelv, that is, twentie four in all. This Circle is the onelie one above the <hi>Globe,</hi> which is not imagined upon the Earth, but is there placed to ſhew the hour of the daie and night, in anie place where the Daie and night exceed not 24 hours: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>Cyclus Horarius.</hi> The <hi>Hour Circle,</hi> for which purpoſe it hath a little Braſs pin turning about upon the <hi>Pole,</hi> and pointing to the ſeveral hours, which therefore is called the <hi>Index Horarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſmall Circle is framed upon this ground, that in the <hi>Diurnal Motion</hi> of the Heaven 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi> riſe up in the ſpace of everie one hour, that is 360 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or the whole <hi>Circle</hi> in the ſpace of 24. So that the <hi>Cyclus Horarius</hi> is to bee framed to that <hi>Compaſs,</hi> as that everie 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of it, or one hour is to bear proportion to 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equator</hi> below it. And ſo in turning the <hi>Globe</hi> about, one may perceiv, that while the Pin is moved from anie one hour to another, juſt 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> will riſe up above the <hi>Horizon</hi> upon one ſide, and as manie more go down below it on the other ſide. But this <hi>Circle</hi> is not much for the <hi>Geographer's</hi> uſe.</p>

                     <head>Of the Horizon.</head>
                     <p>THe other <hi>Great Circle</hi> without the <hi>Globe</hi> is the <hi>Horizon;</hi> upon which (yet not as due to this Circle more then anie other, but becauſ there is more room) the <hi>Geographers</hi> ſet down the 12. Signs with their Names and Characters.</p>
                     <p>And becauſ everie Sign of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> containeth 30 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is 360 for the whole Circle, the <hi>Horizon</hi> is divided into 360 Degrees indeed as it ought, but not from 10, 20, 30, 40, ſo throughout, but by Thirties, that is, 10, 20, 80. and 10, 20, 30. and ſo along to make the diviſion conform to the 12 Signs, to each of which, as I ſaid, is allotted the Number of 30 Degrees. And the reaſon of that is in reference to the Suns Annual Motion, in the Courſ whereof hee diſpatcheth everie daie one degree under or over. So that hee paſſeth through each of the <hi>Signs</hi> in, or in much about the ſpace of 30 Daies. So that, though ſom of the 12 Moneths, anſwering to the 12 <hi>Signs,</hi> conſiſt of one Daie more then thirtie, and one of 2 Daies leſs, yet take them one with another, and the Daies of everie Moneth correſpond to the ſeveral Degrees of everie <hi>Sign,</hi> or without anie conſiderable difference. And after that rate, or much about it, they are placed upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> to ſhew in what Degree, of what Sign the Sun is everie daie of the year. And to this purpoſe there is ſet down upon the ſame <hi>Horizon</hi> a <hi>Calendar,</hi> and that of three ſorts in ſom Globes: Of two in the moſt, the one whereof is called the <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Old,</hi> the other the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> or <hi>New Accompt,</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this latter 10 daies before the former, and the third ſort, where it is found, thirteen. Now though it bee true that the greateſt part of that which is written upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> more nearly concerneth the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> then the <hi>Terreſtrial Globe;</hi> yet it is not altogether unuſeful here: and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it will bee nothing out of the <hi>Geographer</hi>'s way to take along with him the ground of Difference in the 3, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the 2 ſorts of <hi>Calendars.</hi>

                     <p>A Year is that ſpace of time in which the <hi>Sun</hi> goeth through the whole Circle of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> as from the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> to the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer</hi> again, or from the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> to the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> or from anie other Point of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> to the ſame again. Now, becauſ of the unequal Motion of the Sun (depending upon reaſons deeply engaged in the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Part of the <hi>Spheer,</hi> and therefore here to bee taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt) it ever was, and yet is, a very hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine exactly in what ſpace of time this <hi>Revolution</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> is made; inſomuch that one ſaid,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> de Die Natali.</note> that the Year conſiſted of ſo manie daies, and how much more or leſs no bodie knoweth.</p>
                     <p>This uncertaintie brought ſo much confuſion upon the Old <hi>Romane Calendars,</hi> that <hi>Time</hi> with them was grown a Commoditie, and bought and ſold at a price. Their Prieſts, who had to do with this Affair, having in their power to make anie year longer or ſhorter at their pleaſure; which the Emperor <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> looking upon as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no waie below his greateſt conſideration, adviſed with ſom Egyptian Mathematicians about it, by whoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions hee found that the Sun's yearlie Motion in the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> was performed in the ſpace of 365 daies, and one 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of a daie, or 6 hours.</p>
                     <p>The 6 odd hours hee cauſſed to bee reſerved in ſtore till everie fourth year, that is, till they made 24 hours, or one whole daie; ſo accounting, that the 3 firſt years ſhould conſiſt of 365 daies, and the fourth of 366, one daie more; and everie fourth year was therefore (as ſtill it is) called the <hi>Leap Year,</hi> and the thing it ſelf <hi>Intercalation,</hi> or putting in betwixt the <hi>Calendar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Twas verie much that the Emperor did, and hee left as much to do; for though it cannot yet bee found out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58600:250"/> in what ſpace of the time the <hi>Sun</hi> goeth his yearlie courſ, yet thus much is made good by infallible experience that the Emperor's <hi>Mathematicians</hi> allotted too much for the Number of daies: they were in the right, for it it is certain no year can conſiſt of more then 365, but for the odd hours it is as certain that they cannot bee fewer then five, nor ſo manie as 6; ſo that the doubt is upon the <hi>Minutes,</hi> 60 whereof go to the making up of an Hour; a ſmall matter one would think, and yet how great in the receſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence wee ſhall ſee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> allotted 365 daies and 6 hours to this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but the <hi>Sun</hi> goeth about in leſs time, that is, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt exact Accompt) in 365 daies, 5 hours, 49 Minutes, and a little more; ſo that the Emperor's year is much about 10 Minutes greater then the <hi>Sun</hi>'s, which muſt of neceſſitie breed a difference of ſo manie Minutes everie year, betwixt the <hi>Year,</hi> which the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe's in the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> and <hi>That,</hi> which is reckoned upon in the <hi>Calendar,</hi> which though for a year or two may paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, yet in the ſpace of 134 years it will riſe to an whole daie, that is the Begining of the year in the <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> muſt bee ſet one daie back. As for Example: Let the year begin at the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> or Spring: In the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's time that fell out to bee at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but now this year it fell out upon the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 13 daies back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſomwhat more, and ſo if it bee let alone will go back to the 1 of <hi>March,</hi> and 1 of <hi>Februarie,</hi> till <hi>Eaſter</hi> com to bee on <hi>Chriſtmas Daie,</hi> and ſo infinitely.</p>
                     <p>To reform this difference in the Accompt, ſom of the later <hi>Romane Biſhops</hi> earneſtly endeavoured. And the thing was brought to that perfection it now ſtandeth in (ſo much as it is) by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in the Year 1582. His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> (whereof <hi>Lilius</hi> was the chief) adviſed him thus: That conſidering there had been an Agitation in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> ſomwhat concerned in this matter upon the motion of that Queſtion about the <hi>Celebration</hi> of <hi>Eaſter:</hi> And that the Fathers of that Aſſemblie after due delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Aſtronomers of that time, had fixed the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58600:250"/> Equinox</hi> at the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and conſidering alſo that ſince that time a difference of 10 whole daies had been paſt over in the <hi>Calendar,</hi> that is, that the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> or Spring; which began upon the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> had prevented ſo much as to begin in <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s daies at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame, 10 daies difference or thereabouts; they adviſed that 10 daies ſhould bee cut off from the <hi>Calendar,</hi> which was don, and the 10 daies taken out of <hi>October</hi> of that Year 1582, as being the Moneth of that Year in which that <hi>Pope</hi> was born; ſo that when they came to the 5 of the Moneth, they reckoned the 15, and ſo the <hi>Equinox</hi> was com up to it's place again, and hapned upon the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> as at the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But that <hi>Lilius</hi> ſhould bring back the <hi>Begining</hi> of the Year to the Times of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councel,</hi> and no further, is to be marvelled at. Hee ſhould have brought it back to the Emperor's own time, where the miſtake was firſt entered, and, inſtead of 10, cut of 13 daies; however this is the Reaſon why theſe 2 <hi>Calendars,</hi> written upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> differ the ſpace of 10 daies one from the other. And as the <hi>Old Accompt</hi> was called the <hi>Julian,</hi> from the Emperor; ſo the <hi>New</hi> is called from <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Lilius</hi> the chief Agent, the <hi>Gregorian</hi> or <hi>Lilian Accompt:</hi> and the <hi>Julian</hi> is termed the <hi>Old Style,</hi> the <hi>Gregorian</hi> the <hi>New,</hi> as in the converſation of Letters betwixt Us and Thoſe on the other ſide of the Seas wee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv; Theirs to Us bare date (for the moſt part) ſuch a daie of ſuch a Moneth, <hi>Stylo Novo;</hi> Ours to them ſuch a daie, <hi>Stylo Veteri:</hi> And Theirs may bee dated <hi>There,</hi> by their Accompt, and received here, before they were written by Ours.</p>
                     <p>For the third <hi>Calendar</hi> there need not much bee ſaid, though it bee more abſolute then the ſecond; for it redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Beginings of the Year to the Emperor's own Time, and ſo leaveth the <hi>Old Style</hi> 13 daies behinde as it ought to do. But it is very rarely found upon the <hi>Horizons</hi> of anie <hi>Globes,</hi> neither as yet tranſlated to anie Common Uſe. In the outermoſt Limb of the <hi>Horizon</hi> are ſet down the Names

That of Braſs without the <hi>Globe</hi> is to ſerv all turns, and the <hi>Globe</hi> is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to applie it ſelf thereto. The <hi>Meridians</hi> upon the <hi>Globe</hi> will eaſily bee perceived to bee of a new and another Uſe. They are either the <hi>Great,</hi> or the <hi>Leſs;</hi> not that the <hi>Greater</hi> are greater then the <hi>Leſs,</hi> for they have all one and the ſame <hi>Center,</hi> and equally paſs through the <hi>Poles</hi> of the Earth: but thoſe which are called <hi>Leſs,</hi> are of leſs uſe then <hi>that,</hi> which is called the <hi>Great,</hi> though it bee no greater then the reſt. The <hi>Great</hi> is otherwiſe called the <hi>Fixt</hi> and <hi>Firſt Meridian,</hi> to which the <hi>Leſs</hi> are ſecond, and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively moveable.

They are now called by the Spaniard, <hi>Iſlas de Canaria:</hi> The <hi>Canarie-Iſles,</hi> better known to us by the Wines of that Name, for the moſt part falſly ſo called. <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> as <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo, out of <hi>Juba</hi> the <hi>Affrican</hi> King findeth out but Six of theſe: but the late Diſcoverers meet with Seven: that is, <hi>Lançerotta, Forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventura, Teneriffa, Gomera, Fierro, Patma,</hi> and the <hi>Gran Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,</hi> which giveth Name to the reſt. For the Situation of theſe Iſlands they lie not as <hi>Ptolomie</hi> placed them, within one Degree of <hi>Longitude,</hi> or little leſs, but more ſcattering, and lifted up a little above the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer</hi> about the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree of the <hi>Northern Latitude,</hi> in that Part of the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> (otherwiſe called the <hi>Atlantick) Oceän</hi> which trendeth upon the Coaſt of <hi>Affrick,</hi> and are therefore reckoned by <hi>Geographers</hi> to the <hi>Affrican Iſles.</hi> This was the furtheſt part of the Earth diſcovered towards the <hi>Weſt</hi> to thoſe of about <hi>Ptolomie</hi>'s time: therefore the Great <hi>Meridian</hi> was fixed there, in the Iſle <hi>Hera,</hi> or <hi>Junonia,</hi> as then it was called, now <hi>Tenariff:</hi> And from this <hi>Meridian</hi> all the <hi>Longitudes</hi> in the <hi>Greek-Geographie</hi> are taken.</p>

                     <p>M. <hi>Speed</hi> more particularly profeſſeth to follow <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> as in aſſigning the <hi>Longitude</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> hee ſaith, that it is diſtant from the Weſt 19 Degrees 20 Minutes by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>'s Meaſure.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58600:256"/> the <hi>Canaries;</hi> but in his great <hi>Map</hi> through the <hi>Azores.</hi> M. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Richardſon</hi> in the State of Europe yet more diſtinctly telleth his Reader, That the <hi>Longitudes</hi> in his book ſhall bee taken from that <hi>Meridian,</hi> which paſſeth through the <hi>Azores.</hi> But whether from that in S. <hi>Michaël,</hi> or from the other in <hi>Corvo</hi> is not ſet down, and yet the Difference is 7 Degrees, and more: But hear laſtly the Kingdom's <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Britannia.

                     <p>And now the leaſt that can bee exſpected is, that the <hi>Longitudes</hi> of all Places in the <hi>Britannia</hi> are accounted from the <hi>Meridian</hi> which paſſeth by the <hi>Azores.</hi> But from which of the <hi>Meridians?</hi> If it bee as the book expreſſeth <hi>ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Occidente,</hi> 'tis from that of <hi>Corvo:</hi> then the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tìcians have cauſ to complain, for all the <hi>Longitudes</hi> are falſ. But I can perceiv that the <hi>Geographer,</hi> though otherwiſe moſt accompliſhed, yet was not ſo well ſeen in this piece of the Skill; for though it bee pretended in the Preface that all the <hi>Longitudes</hi> in the Deſcription ſhall bee taken from the <hi>Azores,</hi> yet in ſetting down the <hi>Longitude</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> hee ſaith, That as hee hath it from the Mathematicians of the Place, it is 22 Degrees from the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands</hi> which can never bee true, for 'tis but 19 from the <hi>Azores</hi> reckoning by S. <hi>Michaël:</hi> But this is not all: In aſſigning the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of <hi>Pen-von-las;</hi> or, <hi>The Land's-end</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Hee ſaith that is 17 Degrees <hi>à Fortunatis Inſulis vel potiùs Azoris,</hi> from the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands</hi> or rather from the <hi>Azores.</hi> But is is the Difference ſo ſmall did hee think? But 9 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>But I finde by the <hi>Longitudes</hi> that <hi>Mercator</hi> was the Man that ſet up all theſe for <hi>Geographers.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercator</hi> firſt of all kept himſelf to the Greek <hi>Meridian,</hi> as, <hi>Appian, Gemma Friſius, Maginus,</hi> and others; but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Deip,</hi> an experienced Mariner, that the <hi>Compaſs</hi> had no Variation in the Iſlands of <hi>Capo Verde.</hi> And by others, that it had very little in <hi>Tercera,</hi> and S. <hi>Marie</hi> of the <hi>Azores,</hi> but not anie at all in the Iſle <hi>Corvo,</hi> that hee might go a mean waie to work, and complie with the Common <hi>Meridian</hi> of the World (as hee took it to bee).

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58600:257"/> afterwards taken for Example by <hi>Plancius, Saunderſon,</hi> and the common ſort of others, ſo that little or no notice at all was taken of the <hi>Meridian</hi> by <hi>Corvo,</hi> no not by thoſe of the biggeſt: exſpectation, as M. <hi>Carpenter,</hi> M. <hi>Camden,</hi> M. <hi>Speed,</hi> and the reſt; although this alſo was the known <hi>Meridian</hi> of ſom <hi>Globes</hi> of the very ſame Times; and before that, that is, before they had ſet their laſt <hi>hand</hi> to their <hi>Deſcriptions.</hi> And 'tis no mervail, for <hi>Mercator</hi>'s <hi>Longitudes</hi> were more exactly accounted then before, and therefore they might well take his <hi>Meridian</hi> along with them.

                     <p>THe Reſpect of ſeveral Places one to another, is called the <hi>Difference of Longitude</hi> or <hi>Latitude,</hi> as the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> is 51 Degrees, the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> 55. The <hi>Difference of Latitude</hi> is 4 Degrees. The Uſe of <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude,</hi> in the abſolute ſenſ, was to make out the <hi>Poſition</hi> of anie <hi>Place,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Whole Sphere.</hi> In this other
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58600:263"/> meaning, the Intent is to ſhew the <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Diſtance</hi> of anie Place from and in reſpect of anie other. The <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a Place to another Place, is otherwiſe called the <hi>Angle of Poſition;</hi> but of the <hi>Distance</hi> firſt, and how that is to bee made into Miles.</p>
                     <p>The ſeveral caſes put by the <hi>Geographers</hi> of this <hi>Difference,</hi> are either of <hi>Places</hi> differing in <hi>Latitude</hi> onely, or <hi>Longitude</hi> onely, or both. Places differing in <hi>latitude</hi> onely, are all ſuch as lie under the ſame <hi>Meridian,</hi> but <hi>ſeveral Parallels.</hi> This may ſo fall out, as that either both the Places may bee in <hi>North,</hi> or both in <hi>South Latitude,</hi> or one of them in <hi>each.</hi> If both the Places lie in <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South Latitude,</hi> then it is plain, that if the <hi>leſſer Latitude</hi> bee ſubduced from the <hi>greater,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> of Degrees, multiplied into <hi>Miles</hi> by 60, ſheweth the <hi>Diſtance,</hi> as the <hi>Iſl' de Maio</hi> in the <hi>Latitude</hi> of 14 Degrees; and the Iſle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Michaël</hi> 39 Degrees, are both under the <hi>ſame Meridian:</hi> the 14 Degrees are the <hi>leſſer Latitude,</hi> which taken from the 39 the <hi>greater,</hi> the remainder is 25, which multiplied by 60, giveth the Diſtance in <hi>Miles.</hi> If one of the Places lie in <hi>North,</hi> the other in <hi>South Latitude,</hi> add the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of both <hi>Latitudes</hi> together, and do the like.</p>
                     <p>The verie ſame Courſ is to be taken, if the Places differ in <hi>Longitude</hi> onely, in caſe they both lie under the <hi>Line</hi> it ſelf, becauſ there the meaſure is in a <hi>Great Circle,</hi> as in the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of <hi>Latitude;</hi> but if otherwiſe it fall out to bee in anie <hi>Parallel,</hi> on this or that ſide of the <hi>Line,</hi> the caſe is altered.</p>
                     <p>Wee take for inſtance the Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Charlton,</hi> or <hi>Charls</hi>-Town, in <hi>Charlton</hi> Iſland, ſo honored with the Name of <hi>CHARLS</hi> Prince of WALES, by Captain <hi>Thomas James,</hi> at his Attempt upon the <hi>North-Weſt</hi> Paſſage in the <hi>Wintering,</hi> the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Maie,</hi> the Year 1632, which was the Daie of His Highneſs Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> is 79 Degrees, 30 Minutes, as it was taken from an <hi>Eclipſ</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> obſerved there by the Learned Captain, <hi>Octob.</hi> 29, 1631, and by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Henrie Gellibrand</hi> at <hi>Greſham College</hi> at the ſame time. It is required that this Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> bee converted into <hi>Miles.</hi>

                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:58600:264"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>Charlton</hi> is 52 Degrees, 3 Minutes; that of <hi>London</hi> much about the ſame. Here the proportion of 60 <hi>Miles</hi> to a Degree, will over-reckon the <hi>Distance</hi> almoſt by the half. The reaſon whereof ſhall bee firſt reported out of the Nature of the <hi>Sphere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However it bee certain, that the <hi>Artificial Globe</hi> (as the <hi>Natural</hi> is ſuppoſed to bee) is of a Form preciſely round, and may bee drawn upon all over with <hi>Great Circles</hi> Meridional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet conſidered from the <hi>Middle Line</hi> to the <hi>Poles,</hi> it hath a ſenſible <hi>Inclination</hi> or <hi>Depreſſion</hi> of <hi>Sphere,</hi> as it is termed in their words, ſo that if the <hi>Artificial Globe</hi> bee turned about upon it's <hi>Axel,</hi> ſeveral parts of the ſame Bodie ſhall bee more ſwiftly moved then other at the ſame time; for it is plain, that the <hi>Equator</hi> is moved about in the ſame duration of time, as the ſmalleſt <hi>Parallel,</hi> but the <hi>Circumferences</hi> are of a Vaſt and Viſible Diſproportion, and therefore is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould go an equal pace.</p>
                     <p>It is upon the ſame grounds, that the Autor of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Globe per Terram mobilem</hi> will tell you, that in the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motion of the Earth, though <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (in the ſame <hi>Latitude</hi> with <hi>Oxford</hi>) keep pace with the Iſle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> under the <hi>Line,</hi> yet they are of a very different diſpatch; for <hi>Amſterdam</hi> goeth but 548 Miles in an hour, whereas the Iſle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> poſteth over 900 Miles in the ſame ſpace of time, which is after the rate of 12 Miles in a Minute, and more. And all this is true (that is true to the <hi>Paradox</hi>) from the Inclination of the Sphere: But more plainly yet.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee that the <hi>Meridians</hi> upon the <hi>Globe</hi> are ſet at 10 Degrees Diſtance, but wee may perceiv too that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance groweth leſs and leſs, as the <hi>Meridians</hi> draw nearer towards their concurrence in the <hi>Poles,</hi> as the <hi>Globe</hi> it ſelf doth from the <hi>Equator</hi> upwards, and therefore the Degrees however accounted proportionable, yet cannot poſſibly bee equal in the Leſſer <hi>Parallels</hi> to thoſe in the <hi>Equator,</hi> but muſt needs make an orderlie Diminution from thence to either of the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When therefore it was formerly ſaid that 60 Miles of the Surface of the <hi>Earthlie Globe</hi> anſwer to a degree in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

So that if I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Longitudes</hi> of the <hi>Molucca's,</hi> or anie other parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Line</hi> into Miles, it is but multiplying the Degrees of <hi>Longitude</hi> by 60 and the thing is don; but if I would do the like by <hi>Oxford,</hi> or anie other place betwixt the <hi>Equator</hi> and the <hi>Poles,</hi> I muſt firſt know what number of Miles anſwereth to a Degree in that <hi>Parallel</hi> of <hi>Latitude.</hi> The knowledg of this dependeth upon the proportion which the <hi>Equator</hi> beareth to the <hi>Parallels,</hi> which is learned out by the skill of <hi>Trigonometrie,</hi> but need not now bee ſo hardly attained to; for the Proportions are alreadie caſt up into a <hi>Table</hi> by <hi>Peter Appian</hi> in the firſt Part of his <hi>Coſmographie.</hi> They are there ſet down according to the Rate of <hi>German</hi> Miles, one of which maketh 4 of ours.

                     <p>And very fit it were that theſe Proportions were written upon the <hi>Horizon</hi> of the <hi>Terreſtrial Globes,</hi> rather then the <hi>Calendars.</hi> And what elſ there is, confeſſed by themſelvs to belong of right to the other <hi>Globe,</hi> and of little uſe to the <hi>Geographer,</hi> till this will bee, they may bee cut upon a <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Plate,</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi> of <hi>Box,</hi> or ſom how, or other; for without this <hi>Table,</hi> the Uſe of the <hi>Globe,</hi> as to this Caſe of Difference, is as good as none at all.</p>

                     <p>If you finde, as you needs muſt, that the Proportion of Miles upon the <hi>Globe</hi> doth not alwaies anſwer to that which wee reckon upon in the Earth, you are deſired not to think much; for when it is promiſed that 60 of our Miles ſhall run out a Degree of a Great Circle above, it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this Suppoſition, as if the Earth wee tread upon were preciſely round as the <hi>Globe</hi> it ſelf is, and not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Rivers, Hills, Vallies, &amp;c. which though they bear no proportion otherwiſe, yet becauſ it cometh to paſs by this that wee cannot ſet our courſ in a Streight Line upon the Earth as the Demonſtration is forced to preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, wee muſt bee contented if ſom difference fall out.</p>
                     <p>The more unhappie Difference will bee found in the <hi>Longitudes</hi> themſelvs. The Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Norenberg</hi> (as M. <hi>Gellibrand</hi> hath already made the Obſervation) is according to <hi>Kepler,</hi> but 4 Minutes of Time: <hi>Lansbergh</hi> reckoneth it at 10 Degrees, <hi>Mercator</hi> at 12, <hi>Stadius</hi> at 18, <hi>Longomontanus</hi> at 16, <hi>Stoffler</hi> at 18, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> at 26, <hi>Werner</hi> at 32, <hi>Origan</hi> at 33, <hi>Appian</hi> at 34, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomontanus</hi> at 36: with diſcouragement enough it may bee noted, for the Places are verie eminent, and of a near Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: the Men profeſſed able, and for the moſt part reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſame Great <hi>Meridian;</hi> and yet the leſs to bee wondred at, if wee conſider how much in this caſe muſt bee taken upon truſt, even by theſe Men themſelvs. Wee muſt not think they all ſpake this of their own Knowledg, for it is certain the thing might have been, and is don, though not without anie at all, yet without anie conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement. I ſaie the <hi>Longitudes</hi> for a very great part, are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough agreed on. The perfection is not one Man's, nor one Ages Work, and muſt bee waited for. It muſt not ſeem ſtrange if I tell you that you may diſtinguiſh the more certain from the doubtful by their dſconvenience, for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58600:267"/> where you finde them to agree, you have cauſ to ſuſpect (for the moſt part) that they have lien long upon the Lees of Time, not as yet enquired into. But if you finde them to diſagree, you may conclude that they have been brought to a new Examination. And of theſe, you are to take the lateſt, and from ſuch (if it may bee) as have don it by their own Obſervation, as out of the Tables of <hi>Tycho</hi> before others. The difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> by <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Tables betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Norenberg</hi> is under 4 Degrees, which cometh neareſt to <hi>Kepler,</hi> who alſo took it himſelf from two ſeveral obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Moon. There will ſtill ſeem to bee ſom want of ſatisfaction, but it is ſufficient for anie man to know in this as much as anie other man doth.</p>
                     <p>If you would convert the Degrees of <hi>Longitude</hi> into Hours (for this alſo may bee don as well into Miles) you are to allow 15 Degrees to one Hour, upon the Reaſons taught before; and that which will bee gained by this is to know, by how much ſooner or later the Sun Riſeth, or Setteth to one Place then to another. As the Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> betwixt <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Charlton</hi> is 79 Degrees, 30 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: that is, 5 Hours, 18 Minutes: and becauſ <hi>Charlton</hi> lieth Weſt from <hi>London,</hi> the Sun Riſeth ſo much ſooner here then there.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Globe there are manie (Meridians) drawn, all which paſs through the Poles, and go North and South; but there is one more remarkable than the reſt drawn broad with ſmall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which runneth thorough the Canarie-Iſlands or</hi> Azores, <hi>Weſtward of</hi> Spain, <hi>which is counted the firſt Meridian in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of reckoning and meaſuring of Diſtances of places one from another; for otherwiſe there if neither firſt nor laſt in the round Earth: But ſom place muſt bee appointed where to begin the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: And thoſe Iſlands have been thought fitteſt, becauſ no part of the World that laie Weſtward was known to the Antients fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that: and as they began to reckon, there wee follow them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as concerning <hi>Mercator</hi> himſelf you have more to look to. <hi>Mercator</hi>'s conſtant <hi>Meridian</hi> was that by S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaël,</hi> and ſo you will finde it in the <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſet out by <hi>Rumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> But in that of <hi>Hondius Edition</hi> lately tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you will finde it otherwiſe, though you ſhall ſee too in what a fair waie you are to bee deceived of this alſo.</p>
                     <p>In the Deſcription of <hi>Iſland,</hi> pag. 33. The Book ſaith, <hi>It is ſituated not under the firſt Meridian, as one hath noted, but in the eighth Degree from thence.</hi> To which the Margin (but not knowing what) ſaith,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That this firſt Meridian is a great Circle rounding the Earth from Pole to Pole, and paſſing thorough the Iſlands called</hi> Azores, <hi>and namely the Iſle of S.</hi> Michaël, as the ſame Noter to pag. 10.</p>
                     <p>Hee might think hee went upon a ground good enough; for in the ſeventh Chapter of the <hi>Introduction, Mercator</hi> himſelf, ſaith thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ptolomie hath placed the firſt Meridian in the Fortunate Iſles; which at this daie are called the Canaries. Since, the Spaniſh Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58600:276"/> have placed it in the Iſle of Goſs-hauks, which in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage are called</hi> Aſſores, <hi>and ſom of them placed it in the middle of Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now wee muſt hold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that the Longitude is a certain ſpace or interval of the Equator cloſed between Meridians, the one from the Iſles called Azores, from whence it taketh the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the other, from that Place or Region, whereof wee would know the Diſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet for all this the <hi>Longitudes</hi> in that Book are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> as you may ſee in the Eaſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere,</hi> and in the general Deſcription of <hi>Africa.</hi> The Editioner <hi>Hondius</hi> would have it ſo, and (which is marvel the <hi>Marginal Noter</hi> could chuſe but know) hee himſelf in the verie Begining maketh this Profeſſion of it;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>and wee in this Book do make the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to bee a ſegment of the Equator comprehended betwixt the Meridian of the place, and the Meridian of the Fortunate Iſlands, for from theſe Iſlands the Begining of Longitude is taken,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The like Note hee affixeth to the Deſcription of <hi>New-Spain:</hi> his meaning in both is, to let the Reader know that the Deſcriber (who ever hee was) did not in theſe <hi>Maps</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Degrees of <hi>Longitude,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> from Weſt to Eaſt, and from the <hi>Fortunate Iſles;</hi> but from Eaſt to Weſt, and from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Toledo Hiſpaniae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilico;</hi> which is the meaning of <hi>Mercator,</hi> when hee ſaith, That ſom of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilots placed the Great <hi>Meridian</hi> in the middle of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58600:277"/> 
                        <hi>Spain.</hi> And if you look upon the <hi>Longitude</hi> in the North and South ſides of the <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> you ſhall ſee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees reckoned backwards contrarie to the received manner of <hi>Graduation.</hi> It is no verie hard matter to reduce theſe <hi>Longitudes</hi> to the ordinarie waie, but rather then ſo, you may have recourſ to the Later Deſcription of <hi>America,</hi> by <hi>Leat</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Scale,</hi> in particular <hi>Maps</hi> extending to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude,</hi> it dependeth for the ground upon the Degrees of the Great Circle, and the Proportion of Miles in ſeveral Countries to anie ſuch Degree. But in Leſſer Deſcriptions it hath more to do with the known diſtance of anie two, or more places experimentally found, or taken upon truſt of Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                     <p>Here it is not to bee thought that the <hi>Longitudes</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> of all Places in a particular <hi>Chart</hi> need to bee taken, but of the Principal onely, the reſt to bee reduced by the <hi>Radius,</hi> the <hi>Angle</hi> of Poſition, and the like; and much alſo in this matter uſeth to bee given to the Common Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; all which, the laſt eſpecially are the Cauſſes why the <hi>Maps</hi> agree no better, for of all other the Account of the Common People is moſt uncertain.</p>
                     <p>The French <hi>Coſmographer</hi> of <hi>Amiens</hi> before named, when hee took upon him to finde out how manie of their Leagues anſwered to a Degree, took his Journie from <hi>Paris</hi> as directly under the <hi>Meridian</hi> as hee might, till hee rode 25 Leagues according to the Account of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Place. <hi>Nec tamen vulgi ſupputationem ſatiatus</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>vehiculum quod</hi> Pariſios <hi>rectâ viâ petebat conſcendi in eóque reſidens tota via</hi> 17024 <hi>ferè rotae circumvolutiones col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legi, vallibus &amp; Montibus (quod facultas noſtra ferebat) ad aequalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem redactis.

His ergò revolutionibus per quatuor ductis reperi paſſus</hi> 68096 <hi>qui milliaira ſunt Italica</hi> 68, <hi>cum paſſibus</hi> 96. In his return to <hi>Paris</hi> hee took Coach, the Diameter of the Wheel was 6 foot and a little more, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58600:277"/> the Circumference 20 foot, that is, 4 paces. Hee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned upon the waie 17024 circumrotations of the Wheel, which multiplying by 4 the <hi>Numerus factus</hi> was 68006 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which amounted to 68 Miles <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſomwhat more. And yet according to Common Supputation they that reckon moſt, reckon but 25 Leagues to a Degree, and 60 Miles to 25 Leagues 8 Miles leſs. The <hi>Coſmographer</hi> addeth indeed, that by the ſame experiment hee found, that the <hi>French</hi>-League was of a greater proportion then two <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Miles.</p>
                     <p>If it could bee exſpected that ſo exact a courſ might bee taken in all particular Menſurations, wee might put the more truſt in the diſtances, and yet you ſee wee might fail too. It is enough in ſuch a caſe to know the reaſons of thoſe uncertainties where the thing it ſelf is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of Miles in ſeveral Countries is great, but it will bee enough to know that the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> are reckoned for all one, and four of theſe make a <hi>German</hi> Mile; two, a <hi>French</hi>-League; three, and ſomwhat more, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-League; the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> Mile conſiſteth of five Miles <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſomwhat more.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Miles of ſeveral Countries do verie much differ, ſo thoſe of the ſame do not verie much agree: and therefore the <hi>Scales</hi> are commonly written upon with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna, Mediocria, Parva,</hi> to ſhew the Difference.</p>
                     <p>Of Common <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Miles 60 (as you know already) anſwer to a Degree of a Great Circle: 68 ſaith <hi>Fernelius:</hi> it ought to bee 63 and ſomwhat more by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter</hi> of the Earth, as it was taken by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
