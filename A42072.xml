            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And if both places be conÅ¿idered, 'tis to be judg'd that nothing was recorded in this Booke but Memorialls of this kinde, and which is more to be noted, they were metricall too. The place in <hi>JoÅ¿hua</hi> put to this here maketh it cleare. There it is quoted out of the Booke of <hi>JaÅ¿her,</hi> that the Sun Å¿tood Å¿till in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moone in the valley of <hi>Ajalon.</hi> This Quotation is a plaine Canticle. <hi>Chimhi</hi> commeth Å¿o neare to the matter, as onely to make a doubt of it. But the thing is certain, It is reckoned among the 10 Songs by the Mechilta an old Commentary upon <hi>Exodus</hi> to the 15 Chapter. The 4 is that of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> before his deceaÅ¿e: and the 6 is that of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and this of <hi>JoÅ¿hua</hi> is the fifth. I would Å¿ay more of this had not the learned <hi>MaÅ¿ius</hi> prevented me upon the place, <hi>JoÅ¿h.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 12. This is enough to Å¿hew that the Song of the Bow might, but the uÅ¿e of it could not be Å¿et downe in the Booke of <hi>JaÅ¿her.</hi> It is certaine that this command of <hi>David</hi> to the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> is not delivered in Meeter. Indeed matter of that kinde was no fit Å¿ubject for a Song. And now 'tis come to <hi>Tyndalls</hi> turne againe, for the <hi>New</hi> muÅ¿t be corrected by his <hi>Old TranÅ¿lation.</hi> He rendered thus, <hi>And</hi> David <hi>Å¿ang this Song of Mourning over</hi> Saul <hi>and over</hi> Jonathan <hi>his Sonne, and bade to teach the Children of IÅ¿rael the Staves thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I may note one thing more, and I marvaile at it too, that the vulgar Edition hath one verÅ¿e over and above in the Canticle of the Bow. <hi>ConÅ¿idera IÅ¿rael pro his qui mortui Å¿unt, Å¿uper excelÅ¿a tua vulnerati.</hi> It Å¿eemeth to pretend as if it would tranÅ¿late the firÅ¿t verÅ¿e of the Song; but that's done, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too, immediately in the next, <hi>Jnclyti IÅ¿rael Å¿uper Montes tuos interfecti tunt. Quomodo ceciderunt fortos?</hi> I found it Å¿o in Å¿ome of the written as well as the printed Copies: And yet I think <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> did better to leave it out, then Å¿ome others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58600:19"/> Å¿ince to keep it in. It is plainly void and Å¿upernumerary, and an eÅ¿cape not fit to be accounted upon the SageneÅ¿Å¿e of that tranÅ¿lation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To the ReÅ¿pect of the QueÅ¿tion we know already that the greateÅ¿t enterviews 'twixt God and man paÅ¿Å¿e eÅ¿pecially upon the termes of theÅ¿e two Attributes <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>JuÅ¿tice,</hi> where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o it will be Å¿omething too, to obÅ¿erve how Mercy rejoyceth againÅ¿t Judgement.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrewes note, <hi>Quando egreditur Å¿ententia ad Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiam &amp;c.</hi> That in all proceedings of God with men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in mercy and loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, he chuÅ¿eth to be called by his great Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as to <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in the Clift of the Rock, <hi>Jehova Jehova. The Lord mercifull and gracious, Å¿low to anger, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as the Å¿ame Doctors obÅ¿erve, <hi>Quando egreditur Å¿ententia ad juÅ¿titiam, &amp;c.</hi> In any proceÅ¿Å¿e of JuÅ¿tice and Judgement, &amp;c. he alwayes Å¿tileth himÅ¿elfe <hi>Eloah</hi> or <hi>Elohim.</hi> So the matter will be to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h of the uÅ¿e and dignity of theÅ¿e two names as to this purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jehovah</hi> is his proper name of his owne ImpoÅ¿ition,<note place="margin">Iehovah.</note> and incommunicable to any Creature, of what Rank or Quality Å¿oever: a Name of Å¿uch immoderate Reverence amongÅ¿t the oldeÅ¿t Jewes, that it was forbidden to be written right or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at all in this world, but by the High PrieÅ¿t, and but in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58600:20"/> one place, the <hi>Å¿anctum Å¿anctorum,</hi> and but at one time of the year, in the day of expiation.</p>
                     <p>And (which is more to the purpoÅ¿e) onely in one caÅ¿e, which was that of Benediction, when the BleÅ¿Å¿ing and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e of God by the holy intervention of the PrieÅ¿t was to be derived downe upon the People.</p>
                     <p>At any other time or in what place Å¿oever for any man of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> to preÅ¿ume to utter this Name was more then death by the Law, as by a report of theirs in the Talmud in the caÅ¿e of <hi>Teradion's</hi> Å¿onne.</p>
                     <p>And as it would Å¿eem to be by the Jewes, our Saviour might not himÅ¿elfe make uÅ¿e of this Name in kinde: for after their malicious rate of Tradition, they hold that he did all his miracles by the <hi>ParaphraÅ¿ticall Tetragrammaton,</hi> or <hi>Shem ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoraÅ¿h</hi> (as they call this Name at length and in other words) and this way of Enunciation they Å¿ay was cut into his feet, and produced as occaÅ¿ion Å¿erved, as to caÅ¿t out Devills (by a knowne ReceÅ¿Å¿e of the blacke Art) through <hi>him that is the Prince.</hi> And to exalt and make up the Legend they can afford his mother (the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Virgin to us, and very well Å¿poken of in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it Å¿elfe) no better language then that Å¿he was a cunning woman, and brought this kinde of Legerdemain out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Elohim.</note>
                        <hi>Elohim</hi> (Å¿aith a great MaÅ¿ter in the Language) <hi>Nomen divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Ã  Juvicio, quaÅ¿i Deus Iudex,</hi> though I thinke he tranÅ¿lated this Å¿enÅ¿e rather from the uÅ¿e then the power and Originall of the word, which retained (as many other) in the <hi>Arabicke,</hi> though not in the Hebrew; reacheth not to this meaning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly (and yet not unfitly) for there it Å¿ignifieth firÅ¿t for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and force, and nothing could more properly make up the Judge of all the world in words, then Å¿uch as were derived from a Å¿enÅ¿e of Omnipotency. And to this the Scripture bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneÅ¿Å¿e and correÅ¿pondency enough.</p>
                     <p>Now this Name of <hi>Elohim</hi> is not proper to God, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with the Creature. The Angels are called Å¿o, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 86.8. Men are called Å¿o, (the Judges eÅ¿pecially) <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. Nay and the falÅ¿e Gods too. <hi>JoÅ¿hua</hi> 23.16. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58600:20"/> Å¿umme is, that the Name <hi>Iehova</hi> was of higher Import and eÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then that of <hi>Elohim.</hi> AlÅ¿o that in addreÅ¿Å¿es of mercy and loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e God was pleaÅ¿ed to bee called rather by the former, but in thoÅ¿e of <hi>Execution</hi> and <hi>Sentence</hi> by the later.</p>
                     <p>Therefore our Saviour (in the caÅ¿e he was) cryed not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova Jehova:</hi> (much leÅ¿Å¿e Father, as at other times) but <hi>Eli Eli,</hi> or <hi>Eloi Eloi,</hi> My God, My God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as naming the Judge of all the world, and doing the extreameÅ¿t right upon his own Sonne treading the WinepreÅ¿Å¿e alone under the perÅ¿on of all Mankinde.</p>

                     <p>Seeing therefore that the Jewes and they had once the very Å¿ame <hi>Kibla,</hi> and now have the Å¿ame by imitation, that which is pretended to, is of eaÅ¿ie conÅ¿equence.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I was forced for the preÅ¿ent to make uÅ¿e of this way of proof, becauÅ¿e I could not be fully enough Å¿atisfied as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>And at the abatement of theÅ¿e waters when <hi>God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Noah,</hi> the Å¿ame Fountaines of this <hi>Deepe</hi> are Å¿aid to have beene Å¿topped <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.2. which can admit of no other (but an miraculous) Å¿enÅ¿e; for we cannot underÅ¿tand it of any Å¿ubterraneous AbyÅ¿Å¿e, without an open defiance to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Therefore betwixt the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Heaven of Heavens</hi> there muÅ¿t be a <hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> or <hi>great Deepe,</hi> and for this it is that he is Å¿aid to have layed the Beames of his <hi>Chambers</hi> in the waters, <hi>PÅ¿alm.</hi> 104.3. His upper Chambers it Å¿hould be (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> rightly) and it maketh very much for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it will follow from this that theÅ¿e Chambers were the Heaven of Heavens. Where <hi>the Lord is upon many</hi> (or great) waters. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 29.3. And <hi>WiÅ¿dome</hi> Å¿aw him <hi>Å¿et this compaÅ¿Å¿e up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Face of the Depth.

                     <p>And he is Å¿aid to have watered the Hills from theÅ¿e Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 104.13. Not from the <hi>middle Region</hi> of the <hi>Aire,</hi> for the Tops of Å¿ome Hills (<hi>whoÅ¿e heights are his, PÅ¿al.</hi> 95.4.) are lifted up above all the Clouds. But he watered the Hills from this great AbyÅ¿Å¿e, when at the flood thoÅ¿e Cataracts of Heaven were opened.</p>

                     <p>I am almoÅ¿t perÅ¿waded to thinke, that untill <hi>Neahs</hi> time <hi>The Lord God had not cauÅ¿ed it to raine upon the Earth, but a miÅ¿t went up and watered the whole face of the ground. Gen.</hi> 2.5, 6. And a River went forth of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden

                     <p>It is no Å¿tranger a thing then to finde the whole Earth in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e for that time as the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath beene ever Å¿ince, or thoÅ¿e everlaÅ¿ting Hills which (the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> Å¿et out) were never yet <hi>wetted with the dew of Heaven.</hi> If it bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e, how could he then firÅ¿t Å¿et his Bow in the Cloud? for as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> Å¿aid it muÅ¿t have been there before.</p>

                     <p>OF the interruption of the Soules Immortality, betwixt the moment of death (it muÅ¿t not now be call'd Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is the inÅ¿idious debate of theÅ¿e eager dayes. A fitter and more congeneall time to bring this MonÅ¿ter to the Birth, (though there is not Å¿trength to bring forth) was never yet endeavoured to be wreÅ¿ted out of the hands of Providence, by the greateÅ¿t deepneÅ¿Å¿e of Satan.</p>
                     <p>The Familiar that converÅ¿ed Å¿o much with <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Father told him, That their Spirits and the Devils dye too. 'Twere good believe this alÅ¿o.</p>
                     <p>But if the BeaÅ¿ts and we have all one breath, then why doe not their Spirits too return to God that gave them? If Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption have put Corruption on, we may very well eate and drinke as we doe, for to morrow we dye indeed.</p>
                     <p>The unlikely Heathen ploughed in more hope then Å¿o. In Hieroglyphicall learning, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Å¿et downe the <hi>Axis</hi> of a <hi>Pyramis</hi> for the Soule, and therefore the Figure of their Sepulchers was Pyramidall. The myÅ¿tery is Geometricall, that as by the converÅ¿ion or turning about of a Pyramid upon his Axis, the axis remaining Å¿til the Å¿ame, there is a Mathematical creation of a new Å¿olid or Cone, Å¿o by the Revolution of a certaine time of yeares about the Å¿oule (the Å¿oule continuing Å¿till the Å¿ame in a conÅ¿tant courÅ¿e of immortality) a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Å¿hall ariÅ¿e and reunite again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">AuguÅ¿tin. Steuch Eugubin.</note>Indeed he that will turn over the Bookes, <hi>De perenni Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophia,</hi> will finde that theÅ¿e Heathens did beleeve not onely this, but the greateÅ¿t part of our Divinity more then we our Å¿elves doe.</p>
                     <p>I am induced to beleeve that without any further Å¿ubtilty or arrogancy of diÅ¿pute, there is an invincible argument for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58600:79"/> the thing Å¿ecretly imprinted in the InÅ¿tinct and ConÅ¿cience of the Soul it Å¿elf, becauÅ¿e it is every good mans hope that it Å¿hall be Å¿o, and every wicked mans feare that it will. And that at leaÅ¿t a parcell judgment may preÅ¿ently be pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>wandring Soule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However the opportunity of this part of Scripture doth not Å¿o directly call upon me to any Å¿uch kinde of ControverÅ¿ie. Indeed I would be taken to be Å¿o Å¿ecure of the Souls Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that I am going about to leave the Body it Å¿elfe in a very fair Condition of Incorruption. And I Å¿ee not but that it may very well Å¿uit with the Immoderations of the time to advance up the immortality of the Body, when men have Å¿o little to doe as to raiÅ¿e Å¿uÅ¿picions upon that of the Soule.</p>
                     <p>The Jewes commonly expreÅ¿Å¿e ReÅ¿urrection by Regermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or growing up again like a Plant. So they doe in that Å¿trange tradition of theirs, of the <hi>Luz</hi> an immortal little bone in the bottome of the <hi>Spina dorÅ¿i;</hi> which though our Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ts are bound to deride as a kinde of <hi>Terra incognita</hi> in the LeÅ¿Å¿er world, yet theirs, (who know the Bones too, but by Tradition) will tell ye that there it is, and it was created by God in an unalterable Å¿tate of incorruption, that it is of a Å¿lippery condition and maketh the Body but beleeve that it groweth up with, or receiveth any nouriÅ¿hment from that. Whereas indeed the <hi>Luz</hi> is every wayes immortally diÅ¿pos'd, and out of whoÅ¿e everliving <hi>Power</hi> fermented by a kinde of dew from Heaven, all the dry Bones Å¿hall be reunited and knit together, and the whole Generation of mankinde recruite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>There is a better temper and holding a more lawfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿pondency in that Rite of theirs, which of old they obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Å¿till doe at their Funerall Celebrations.</p>
                     <p>It is thus taken notice of by their late <hi>Rabbine Leo Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena, Nel ritorno dalla foÅ¿Å¿a, ogn' uno Å¿pianta dell' herba dalla terra, due o tre volte, e Å¿e la getta dietro dicendo quelle parole del Salmo, eÅ¿puntarano dalla citta come l'herba della terra, per Å¿egno della reÅ¿urrectione.</hi> That is, As they returne backe from the Grave, every one of them plucketh up the GraÅ¿Å¿e from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58600:80"/> ground twice or three times, and throweth it behind him, Å¿aying thoÅ¿e words of the PÅ¿alme, <hi>(they Å¿hall flouriÅ¿h out of the City like the graÅ¿Å¿e of the Earth)</hi> in token of the ReÅ¿urrection, &amp;c. <hi>De gli riti Hebraici di queÅ¿ti tempi Part.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>In Å¿ome places they Å¿ay theÅ¿e very words of the Prophet here, <hi>Your Bones, &amp;c.</hi> The Rite is very proper, as to Å¿hew that the dead are not quite pluckt up, but only cut down like a flower, which at the returne of time reinforcing from its root and Å¿tock, Å¿pringeth up again.</p>
                     <p>But if our Bones are to flouriÅ¿h like an Hearbe, wee have a Å¿urer word of experience from the Fact. If a vegetable can be call'd up out of its aÅ¿hes, there is a Å¿tronger pretence to our urnes.</p>
                     <p>The Grounds of Chimicall PhiloÅ¿ophy goe thus.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are the principles into which all things doe reÅ¿olve. And that the Radicall and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall moiÅ¿ture whereby the firÅ¿t principall of <hi>Salt</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿teth, cannot be conÅ¿umed by <hi>Calcination,</hi> but the forcible tinctures and impreÅ¿Å¿ions of things, as Colour, Taft, Smell, nay and the very formes themÅ¿elves are inviÅ¿ibly kept in Å¿tore in this firm and vitall principle.</p>
                     <p>To make this good by the Experiment, they take a RoÅ¿e, Gillyflower, or any kinde of Plant whatÅ¿oever. They take this Simple in the Spring time, in its fulleÅ¿t and moÅ¿t vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conÅ¿iÅ¿tence.

                     <p>In regard unto this great and glorious preÅ¿ence, I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to reflect upon two principall inconÅ¿iderations.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58600:88"/> only to thoÅ¿e that are made in this place.

For the EaÅ¿tern faÅ¿hion is to have a Gate almoÅ¿t to every Å¿treet, Å¿o that theÅ¿e Corners of the Å¿treets were eminently open and the fitteÅ¿t places that could be choÅ¿en for one to pray in, that did it therefore that <hi>hee might bee Å¿een of men.</hi>

                     <p>The King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was heard upon his bed, but his prayer, what was it, but that he might goe once more to Church? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5.

                     <p>That it Å¿hould be wanting in <hi>Å¿ome others</hi> is the leÅ¿Å¿e wonder, becauÅ¿e it is not to be found in that <hi>VetuÅ¿tiÅ¿Å¿imus Codex</hi> given by himÅ¿elfe to the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is not a <hi>full booke</hi> of the <hi>New TeÅ¿tament,</hi> but containing onely the <hi>foure GoÅ¿pels</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the ApoÅ¿tles.</hi> The Booke is written as well in Latine as Greeke, but both in the Å¿ame greeke Character. And it is that of the <hi>great Capitall</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:58600:101"/> kinde, which in their opinion, who uÅ¿e to judge of theÅ¿e things, is the uttermoÅ¿t reputation of antiquity which could be pretended to.</p>
                     <p>In this booke the <hi>ClauÅ¿e</hi> is not to bee found (Å¿o farre as poÅ¿Å¿ibly I can remember) either in the Greek or Latine.</p>
                     <p>I had occaÅ¿ion once to Å¿ay as much as this amounts to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moÅ¿t Reverend and Learned the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the <hi>Doctour of our Chaire</hi> the now worthy <hi>BiÅ¿hop of WorceÅ¿ter,</hi> but was forc't to yeild to Å¿o great a <hi>preÅ¿ence</hi> with this onely anÅ¿wer, that even this <hi>Copy</hi> too was corrupted by the <hi>Heretiques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I knew it might be, and deny not but it may in Å¿ome other part of <hi>Genealogy</hi> or the like, but how any <hi>HaereÅ¿ie</hi> could poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Å¿erve its turne upon this <hi>ClauÅ¿e</hi> (I know that of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) at leaÅ¿t to mee the way doth not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily approve it Å¿elfe.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Arabick</hi> hath it too, not onely the printed Copy by <hi>Erpenius,</hi> but a ManuÅ¿cript too of very <hi>good and gallant note</hi> in <hi>Queenes Colledge Library.</hi> Yet in <hi>the Medicean Copy</hi> I do not meet with it.

                  <p>Thus wee Å¿ee with what confidence this paÅ¿Å¿age of the Storie hath been reported and received, during the Å¿pace of five hundred years, Å¿ince the time of the TranÅ¿lation. And it Å¿eemeth to have been don upon the beÅ¿t Å¿ecuritie; becauÅ¿ not onely the <hi>Jews</hi> and their TalmudiÅ¿ts, but alÅ¿o the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Fathers of the Church, Å¿tand bound to make it good; And theÅ¿e, beÅ¿ides their E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

If they were not, it leÅ¿Å¿eneth but the number of the <hi>Cels;</hi> taketh little awaie from the Miracle of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: or if it did, yet the Å¿ingle teÅ¿timonie of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> will not bee Å¿een through Å¿uch a cloud of WitneÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
                  <p>But beÅ¿ides our Autoritie from the Antients, wee may gain Å¿om probabilitie toward the credit of the <hi>Cels,</hi> if it bee enquired into the CauÅ¿Å¿es which ought to move the King to reÅ¿olv upon Å¿uch a waie for the TranÅ¿lation.</p>
                  <p>Two ReaÅ¿ons eÅ¿pecially may bee urged for this: the one whereof eÅ¿pecially concern's the purpoÅ¿e of the TranÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and both of them the King's Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>For the PurpoÅ¿e of God in the TranÅ¿lation, it was one of thoÅ¿e things which might bee required for the coming in of the Gentiles, that the Scripture Å¿hould bee provided before hand, in Å¿uch a Language as would bee moÅ¿t general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58600:126"/> known at the Primitive times; therefore it was neceÅ¿Å¿arie that all religious care Å¿hould bee had of the TranÅ¿lation, and that it Å¿hould bee Å¿afely laid up and reÅ¿erved for the time appointed: And that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> might Å¿ee to this, it was needful that they Å¿hould bee prepoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t with a Å¿trong Conceit of the Divinitie of this Law: and this could not bee more conveniently don, then by Å¿uch a miraculous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance of the Interpretation: For otherwiÅ¿e, why Å¿hould <hi>Ptolomie</hi> think more divinely of the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> then of his own? Å¿eeing that all waies of Religion would Å¿eem Å¿trange, but that wee are taught betimes to fear: and till wee receiv a Spirit of Judgment to diÅ¿cern the Right waie, everie waie is thought to bee wrong; but that which wee are brought up in. And why Å¿hould <hi>Ptolomie</hi> have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> then of his <hi>Hermes TriÅ¿megiÅ¿t?</hi> who as hee is accounted by Å¿om to have gon before this <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in time, Å¿o by others hee is thought not to have com far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him in worth and excellencie. But what could <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> teach to them, who had all his learning from thence? for hee was brought up a Scholar in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And what would bee thought of theÅ¿e Scriptures, when the King Å¿hould hear it read in <hi>OÅ¿ee,</hi> that God commanded a Prophet to commit Adulterie? and in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that hee taught his own People how to Cozen the <hi>Egyptians?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Solomon: as the WiÅ¿e man dieth Å¿o dieth the Fool,</hi> how would it Å¿tand with their Doctrine of the TranÅ¿migration of Souls? according to which, the Soul of a WiÅ¿e man ought to paÅ¿s into Å¿uch an one; and the Å¿oul of a Fool, into an AÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>For the ReÅ¿urrection of the Bodie, Å¿mall comfort was to bee had from the drie bones in the vallie of <hi>JehoÅ¿aphat.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian</hi> had better hopes then theÅ¿e, for hee had his dead Bodies Å¿till to Å¿hew; and Å¿uch as had gotten by their Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, for they were everie daie leÅ¿s Å¿ubject to Corruption then before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is Å¿aid, That there was no God like the God of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Could the King believ that, when hee Å¿hould finde in theÅ¿e Scriptures that even this God alÅ¿o had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58600:126"/> a <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and a <hi>Son?</hi> or if hee had been Å¿o much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thoÅ¿e of the Heathen, was it likely that <hi>Aaron</hi> his own high PrieÅ¿t would have preferred their <hi>Apis,</hi> or the Calf of <hi>Egypt</hi> before him?</p>
                  <p>when theÅ¿e things Å¿hould com to bee conÅ¿idered by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿anctified diÅ¿cretion of the Heathen, how could they chuÅ¿e but appear far beÅ¿ide, and below their own MajeÅ¿tie? for Å¿uch untoward Notions as theÅ¿e muÅ¿t Å¿eem to bee, could never argue to him that perfection and tranÅ¿cendencie of Style and Matter, which the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> had pretended: therefore that the King might bee brought on to a reverend eÅ¿timation of thoÅ¿e things, it was much to the purpoÅ¿e that hee Å¿hould bee thus prepared by a wonder: for it greatly concern'd the Å¿afetie of the TranÅ¿lation, that it Å¿hould bee firÅ¿t eÅ¿teemed by the King: for otherwiÅ¿e, Principles Å¿o averÅ¿ from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> manner of Devotion, had never been Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie at all, or not long in the Librarie at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> becauÅ¿, even the opinion of a new waie in Religion, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proÅ¿per without a Precedent, and Å¿uch an one as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception; and though it bee never Å¿o wiÅ¿ely Å¿ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿ted, yet it Å¿eldom gaineth reputation from leÅ¿Å¿er exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then that of a King: And it Å¿eemeth, by that wee finde in <hi>JuÅ¿tin Martyr,</hi> that the Miracle wrought the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Å¿ame effect in <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> as wee would have it, for hee Å¿aith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>that the King perceiving that theÅ¿e Å¿even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Men had all agreed, not onely in the matter, but alÅ¿o in the Manner of their Interpretation, inÅ¿omuch that no man differed from another not in a word; but everie man expreÅ¿sed the Å¿ame conceit, and by the Å¿ame phraÅ¿e: hee Å¿tood amazed, and nothing doubting, but that the Interpretation was wrought by Divine Power; hee acknowledged that the Interpreters were worthie of all honor, as beeing Men to whom God did bear a peculiar reÅ¿pect: and having first given them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58600:127"/> condign reward, hee took order for their departure into their own Countrie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And the Å¿ame effect which the wonder wrought upon the Prince, it wrought alÅ¿o upon the People; for Å¿o it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which is alreadie obÅ¿erved out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus wee Å¿ee that the purpoÅ¿e of God in the TranÅ¿lation would not onely endure, but did alÅ¿o varie conveniently require, that Å¿omthing in the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s Å¿hould bee miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for the King's better inÅ¿truction, and that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures might have Å¿o much honor and admiration, as might gain them Å¿omthing in the Opinion of the Heathen, and preÅ¿erv them from the Injuries of Time.</p>
                  <p>And this was to bee the firÅ¿t ReaÅ¿on.</p>
                  <p>The Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on, for which the King ought to take Å¿uch a waie for the TranÅ¿lation, is, For that hee made que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion of their Fidelitie.</p>
                  <p>And that this may bee accepted for a Å¿ufficient CauÅ¿, it Å¿hall bee Å¿et down, That the King's miÅ¿truÅ¿t was raiÅ¿ed upon Å¿uch Å¿urmiÅ¿es as were no way frivolous, but contained in them matter of moment.</p>
                  <p>For it could not bee exÅ¿pected from anie Nation in thoÅ¿e daies, that they Å¿hould bee truÅ¿tie in revealing the Secrets of their Religion; but from the <hi>Jews</hi> it would bee thought impoÅ¿Å¿ible: for this Nation Å¿tood Å¿o nicely affected to their <hi>Sepher Hattocah,</hi> or Book of the Law, that even in the Å¿ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t CircumÅ¿tances, it was obÅ¿erved with an incredible Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oÅ¿itie of Devotion.</p>

                  <p>True it is, than S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in Learning and Knowledg could not bee inferior to anie of his time; and therefore beeing a great Scholar, hee might the eaÅ¿ilier fall into that common infirmitie of thoÅ¿e that know much, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to raiÅ¿ his own Reputation by the ruine of another Man's.

                  <p>Therefore in whatÅ¿oever the Autoritie of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> could prevail againÅ¿t our Storie, it may bee overborn by that which hath been Å¿aid, moÅ¿t of all by the ponderous TeÅ¿timonie of S. <hi>AuguÅ¿tine.</hi>

                  <p>Wee com now to ConÅ¿ider of his ReaÅ¿ons; the later whereof bearing no notable force in it Å¿elf, may bee paÅ¿Å¿ed by, but the former Å¿tandeth thus.</p>
                  <p>That there could bee no Å¿uch miraculous CircumÅ¿tance in the TranÅ¿lation, as this paÅ¿Å¿age of the <hi>Cels,</hi> becauÅ¿ then <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> who undertook a particular Narration of this whole Matter, would not have omitted this, if hee had known it; and hee could not chuÅ¿e but know it, if it had been don, for hee lived at the Å¿ame time, and the ReaÅ¿on prevaileth yet further, becauÅ¿ <hi>JoÅ¿ephus,</hi> relating this HiÅ¿torie out of <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> maketh no mention of anie Å¿uch Matter.</p>
                  <p>This ReaÅ¿on I was alwaies affraid off: for beÅ¿ides that it is the Å¿tronger for beeing given by S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> it hath alÅ¿o

                  <p>But the inconvenience that may ariÅ¿e by this ReaÅ¿on wee Å¿ufficiently avoid, if theÅ¿e three things can bee brought to paÅ¿s. 1. That the HiÅ¿torie of the Septuagint which now goeth abroad under the name of <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> is not the intire work of that <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> who lived in the daies of <hi>Ptolemie.</hi> 2. That the true <hi>AriÅ¿taeas</hi> had this paÅ¿Å¿age of the <hi>Cels.</hi> 3. That <hi>JoÅ¿ephus</hi> left it out, and the ReaÅ¿ons why.</p>
                  <p>For the firÅ¿t, which concerneth <hi>Aristaeas,</hi> That hee is to bee taken for a Å¿purious Autor, wee are already prevented by the learned <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ives Ã  CaÅ¿tro, Scaliger, VoÅ¿Å¿ius,</hi> and others, who have all Å¿et down their judgments againÅ¿t this Autor. and thoÅ¿e that have Å¿poken moÅ¿t moderately, have Å¿aid (that which is the verie truth indeed) That the Compiler of this work was much later then the daies of the TranÅ¿lation, and that the Storie as now it is, was gathered together out of <hi>JoÅ¿ephus, EuÅ¿ebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and Å¿om others, which are not now at all, or not yet extant.</p>
                  <p>But becauÅ¿ the Credit of anie Autor, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e that are Antient ought not to bee diÅ¿paraged upon a Å¿light or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous ground, the CauÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hall bee Å¿et down which have neceÅ¿Å¿arily moved hereunto.</p>
                  <p>The principal ReaÅ¿on rendred by <hi>Vives</hi> and the reÅ¿t, is, For that Å¿om things are cited by the fathers out of <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> which are not to bee found in the Storie as now it Å¿tand's: InÅ¿tance is made in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> concerning the <hi>Cels,</hi> and in the Letters which paÅ¿s'd between <hi>Ptolemie</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> the PrieÅ¿t, which are not delivered by the Fathers, as they lie in the Storie; but have a manifeÅ¿t varietie, and Å¿uch as cannot eaÅ¿ily bee reconciled. This ReaÅ¿on is good, and maketh much againÅ¿t the Compiler, who would bee called by the Name of <hi>AriÅ¿taeas.</hi> But Å¿omthing Å¿hall bee added out of our own ObÅ¿ervation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Justin</hi> hath Å¿aid much for <hi>Alexander</hi> out of <hi>Trogus Pompey,</hi> and much is Å¿et down by <hi>Diodorus;</hi> to Å¿aie nothing of <hi>Zeno Demetrius,</hi> printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in vulgar Greek; and a French Autor not extant, both which have written the life of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> and that they might lie by Autoritie, they have don it in verÅ¿: and yet none of all theÅ¿e ever durÅ¿t to Å¿aie, that this was anie of his Acts, to join <hi>Pharos</hi> to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> nay <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of this <hi>Alexander</hi> Å¿aith, that <hi>Pharos</hi> was an IÅ¿le in thoÅ¿e daies, and verie well intimateth, that the IÅ¿thmus was congeÅ¿ted in after times.

                  <p>But <hi>JoÅ¿eph Scaliger</hi> troubleth us further, for hee Å¿aith, that this IÅ¿thmus was raiÅ¿ed <hi>per Superiores Ptolemaeos,</hi> by the former <hi>Ptolemies:</hi> and his Autoritie for this is out of <hi>Julius CeÅ¿ar,</hi> in the third book of his Commentaries <hi>De Bello Civili,</hi> towards the later end of that Book, there <hi>CeÅ¿ar</hi> Å¿aith thus.</p>

                  <p>At the firÅ¿t reading of theÅ¿e words, I marvailed how <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> could pick out the thing which is pretended, Å¿eeing that here is no intimation to that purpoÅ¿e; but upon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquirie, I found in the Critical Notes upon this Place, that <hi>Brodaeus</hi> would have it read, <hi>A Å¿uperioribus Regibus,</hi> and out of this <hi>varia lectio, Scaliger</hi> got his <hi>Superiores Ptolemaeos.</hi>

                  <p>SuppoÅ¿e wee then that the true waie of reading Å¿hould bee according to <hi>Brodaeus,</hi> yet how will <hi>CeÅ¿ar</hi> bee truÅ¿ted for this, in whoÅ¿e judgment wee all know that the Pailing up of an IÅ¿thmus would bee too great a work for a woman; in compariÅ¿on whereof <hi>CeÅ¿ar's</hi> Ditches and Trenches could bear no reputation? Therefore it concern'd the Dictator to darken the glorie of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for fear that Å¿hould eclipÅ¿ his own: therefore the exploit is obÅ¿curely Å¿ugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted in terms of generalitie and ambiguitie, that it was don <hi>A Å¿uperioribus Regibus,</hi> which whether it bee to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood of <hi>Ptolemie Lagus,</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> or of thoÅ¿e which Å¿ucceeded, who can tell us; and if it bee not, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againÅ¿t us.

                  <p>Let A B C D bee the Horizon, A E C the Meridian, B the EaÅ¿t point, and D the WeÅ¿t. Let B E D bee the Equator cutting the Meridian in E. Let F G H bee for the North Parallel of the Sun, cutting the Meridian in G. Let the Semith of the Place Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to bee between the Equator, and the Å¿aid Parallel bee the Point I, by which draw a vertical Circle K L I M, touching the Parallel F G H in L, and another, N O P I Q cutting the Å¿ame Parallel F G H in the point O, between L the point of Contingencie, and F the point, where the Sun Å¿hall begin to riÅ¿e when hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the Parallel F G H, and again in the Point P, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween L the Å¿aid Point of Contingencie, and the Point G in the Meridian, and draw yet another Vertical F R I S by F the point of the Sun's riÅ¿ing, and therefore cutting the Parallel F G H in R between the Points P and G.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58600:138"/>
                  <p>Now becauÅ¿ the Sun beeing in anie great Circle of the Sphear, the Shadow of anie Style erected upon a Plane, at right Angles, is neceÅ¿Å¿arily projected upon the Common Section of the Plane of the Circle and the Style.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Sun beeing in the Vertical Circle F R I S, and in the point of his riÅ¿ing F, the Å¿hadow of a Style per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly erected upon the Horizon of Å¿uch a Place, whoÅ¿e Semith Point Å¿hall bee in I, cannot recede from the Plane of that Vertical F R I S; but Å¿hall cut the WeÅ¿tern Semicircle of the Horizon in S at the Å¿ame place, where the Parallel T S oppoÅ¿ite to the Parallel of the Sun, cutteth the Horizon; Å¿o that the diÅ¿tance of the Shadow in the Horizon from the Meridian Southward Å¿hall bee the Arch A S. Again the Sun beeing elevated above the Horizon and plac'd in O, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>mmeth to the Vertical N O P I Q, and then the Shadow of the Å¿aid Style Å¿hall cut the Horizon in Q, and the diÅ¿tance from the Meridian will bee the Arch A Q, greater then A S, But when the Sun Å¿hall com to L, the Point of Contingencie, and Å¿o bee in the Vertical K L I M, then the Å¿hadow of the Style Å¿hall cut the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon in M, and the diÅ¿tance of the Shadow from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian will bee the Arch A M, greater then A Q, and the greateÅ¿t which the Shadow can have that daie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore from the time of the Sun's beeing in F, the point of his riÅ¿ing till hee came to L the point of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie, the Shadow of the Style went Å¿till forward from S by Q to M.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the Sun moving from L to P Å¿hall bee again in the Vertical N O P I Q, and the Shadow of the Style Å¿hall again cut the Horizon in Q; and the diÅ¿tance of the Shadow from the Meridian Å¿hall again bee the Arch A Q, as before when the Sun was in the point O. Therefore the Shadow is gon back in the Horizon, from the Point M to Q nearer to the Meridian. Again, the Sun moving from P to R, Å¿hall bee again in the Vertical F R I S; and the Shadow of the Style Å¿hall cut the Horizon in S, and the diÅ¿tance thereof from the Meridian Å¿hall bee the Arch A S, as before when the Sun was in F, the point of his riÅ¿ing.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58600:139"/> Therefore the Shadow is gon back alÅ¿o from M by Q to S. Therefore in anie part of the Torrid Zone, where the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Pole is leÅ¿s then the Declination of the Sun, the Shadow of a Style perpendicularly erected upon a Plane, may have a natural viÅ¿ible RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion, which was required to bee don.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter Novius,</hi> however hee acknowledgeth that the Retrogradation of the Shadow is according to nature in the CaÅ¿e propoÅ¿ed, yet in the Matter of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tandeth it to bee miraculous; and hee maketh the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to conÅ¿iÅ¿t in this, That it was not don as the PropoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requireth, within, but without the Tropicks, between that of Cancer and the Arctick Circle, for in Å¿uch a poÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sphear, the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> was plac'd.</p>
                  <p>But learned <hi>Clavius</hi> (whoÅ¿e waie of demonÅ¿tration wee follow) maketh it plainly to appear, that the Å¿ame thing may bee don as well in the one Place as the other: And it muÅ¿t needs bee Å¿o, for in our own Elevation, here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (which lieth in the Å¿ame PoÅ¿ition of Sphear, though not under the Å¿ame Latitude with theirs at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi>) a Plane may bee fitted for Å¿uch a Polar Altitude as Å¿hall bee leÅ¿s then twentie three degrees and an half, and then it will have the Å¿ame Å¿ite in reÅ¿pect of the Sun, as if it were plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropicks, and Å¿o the RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Shadow muÅ¿t bee as natural as before.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it muÅ¿t bee Å¿aid againÅ¿t <hi>Peter Novius</hi> that the Miracle was not in the going back of the Shadow onely, but the Sun: for Å¿o it is Å¿et down by <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it was Å¿et down in the begining that the moÅ¿t viÅ¿ible part of the Miracle was the RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Shadow: that Å¿hall here bee proved, becauÅ¿ to the Å¿trength of our ObÅ¿ervation it is required that this Å¿hould bee.</p>
                  <p>The moÅ¿t received opinion concerning the Degree in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> is, That they Å¿hould bee meant of Hours: Å¿o indeed the <hi>Targum</hi> rendreth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap> and at the firÅ¿t view it Å¿eemeth moÅ¿t reaÅ¿onable, According to this, the Sun went backwards ten hours, therefore hee had gon forwards 150 Degrees of the Equinoctial line, (for hee is to go everie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58600:139"/> hour fifteen) therefore alÅ¿o hee had yet to go thirtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is the complement of 180. the Semicircle of the daie.</p>
                  <p>The time then of the Miracle was within two hours of night, and the RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Sun it Å¿elf was as viÅ¿ible as that of the Shadow: for hee had gon back above three parts of the HemiÅ¿phear.</p>
                  <p>But this could not bee. For the Prophet ask'd the King whether hee would have the Sun go ten degrees forward, or ten degrees backward: but if degrees bee taken for hours would hee ask him whether hee would have the Sun go 10. hours forward, when there was but two to go? For the Sun was then Occidental, 60 degrees paÅ¿t the Meridian, and within two hours was to leav that Horizon: So that if the King had required, that the Shadow Å¿hould have gon 10. degrees forward, the Prophet muÅ¿t have gon back from his word; for that which was promiÅ¿ed was more then could bee don.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it Å¿eemeth that the degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> are to bee underÅ¿tood of thoÅ¿e in Heaven, where they are moÅ¿t properly and primarily Å¿o called. Therefore the Sun together with the whole frame of the Å¿uperior world, went Å¿o far backward in the diurnal Motion, as made up the Å¿pace of ten degrees in the Equinoctial Line, which anÅ¿wered to two third parts of an hour in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Shadow was much more viÅ¿ible, then that of the Sun: For wee all know that the Å¿pace which the Sun goeth in half an hours time and a little more, is better noted in the Dial, then in the Heavens: For, by reaÅ¿on of the great diÅ¿tance of the Sun's Excentrick from the Å¿urface of the Earth, the Angle of viÅ¿ion is Å¿o Acute, that it cannot transfer a perceivable Å¿pecies of Å¿o rapt a motion. And as it cannot bee perceiv'd in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Å¿o neither would it eaÅ¿ily bee obÅ¿erved when it was gon; for an Arch of 10. degrees in Å¿o vaÅ¿t an Orb as that of the Sun, would never bee diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h'd by thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand here below, unleÅ¿s it were Geometrically obÅ¿erved by a Quadrant or AÅ¿trolabe: the knowledg and practice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58600:140"/> I think was not Å¿o common in the Kingdom of IÅ¿raÃ«l. Therefore though the main condition of this Miracle was, that the Sun it Å¿elf Å¿hould go back, yet that which was moÅ¿t apparent, was the RetroceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Å¿hadow: And becauÅ¿ <hi>JoÅ¿ephus</hi> knew that this would bee accepted among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as a matter not without Nature's compaÅ¿s, hee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, upon this incouragement, to Å¿et down the whole won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For it was not his deÅ¿ire purpoÅ¿ely to Å¿mother anie thing that was Miraculous, but onely Å¿o to qualifie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxall part of things, that they might paÅ¿s among the Heathen without Å¿corn and deriÅ¿ion: Therefore in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where there could bee anie pretenÅ¿, hee uÅ¿eth no diÅ¿Å¿imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. So in the HiÅ¿torie of <hi>Balaam,</hi> hee durÅ¿t to Å¿aie, that a dumb AÅ¿s forbad the madneÅ¿s of the Prophet: 'Twas Å¿trange indeed that an AÅ¿s Å¿hould Å¿peak; but why not an AÅ¿s as well as an Ox? which had often hap'ned in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane State; and once above all the reÅ¿t <hi>Livie</hi> reporteth, that to the great terror of the ConÅ¿ul <hi>Domitius,</hi> an Ox uttered theÅ¿e words,<note place="margin">Livius lib. <hi>35.</hi>

                     <hi>Roma cave tibi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>JoÅ¿ephus</hi> would have been content to do the reÅ¿t, if there could have been the like reaÅ¿on; but beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿irous to train up the Heathen by Probabilities to a good conceit of his Nation, and thoÅ¿e things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them; hee muÅ¿t not laie too great a task upon their belief, and therefore Å¿till when his HiÅ¿torie lead's him to the Narration of a Å¿trange thing, hee alwaies temper's the diÅ¿courÅ¿ with a convenient mixture of PoÅ¿Å¿ibilities; and howÅ¿oever it Å¿omtimes endanger's the main Matter, yet wee Å¿hall Å¿eldom finde him reporting a wonder Å¿incerely; but having warily taken off that which could Å¿eem incredible, hee propoÅ¿eth the Action under Å¿uch eaÅ¿ie circumÅ¿tances, as Å¿hall make it concord with humane reaÅ¿on, and common apprehenÅ¿ion.</p>
                  <p>By this time, the Reader may know the ReaÅ¿on why <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ephus,</hi> when hee is to relate the HiÅ¿torie of the Seventie, out of <hi>AriÅ¿taeas,</hi> willingly omitteth this paÅ¿Å¿age of the <hi>Cels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿ it was like to Å¿ound very incredibly in the Heathen's ears, that a Book Å¿hould bee Å¿o prodigiouÅ¿ly tranÅ¿lated; that

                  <p>Â§. Note one thing more, That the moÅ¿t antient and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal form of ChriÅ¿tian Liturgie, is the order of BaptiÅ¿m<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> It muÅ¿t bee Å¿o in reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and from thence the main parts of all Common Praiers are tranÅ¿lated; the Creeds eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for thoÅ¿e, and the <hi>Pater noÅ¿ter</hi> were the firÅ¿t Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and gave begining to all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service.</p>
                  <p>And if a caÅ¿e Å¿hould lie againÅ¿t the <hi>AthanaÅ¿ian,</hi> I hold the ground to bee good from hence, that it was not properly put into the Liturgie, becauÅ¿ it was not yet received into anie order of BaptiÅ¿m.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Creed</hi> in uÅ¿e, before the Fathers met at <hi>Nice,</hi> muÅ¿t needs bee that which is called ApoÅ¿tolical; for they had no other: But Å¿ince the Councel, the <hi>Nicene</hi> form was generally received into all Orders of BaptiÅ¿m in the other Church, as the Greek, Syriack, Ethiopick, Armenian and Coptick Orders: But the Rubrick in all is as in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, <hi>Haiden amar,</hi> not then the PrieÅ¿t Å¿hall Å¿ing; but, <hi>Tum dicit Sacerdos, Credo in unum Deum, &amp;c.</hi> In the Latine Church indeed, Å¿omtimes the <hi>Symbolum ConÅ¿tantinopolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> was repeted, but moÅ¿t commonly the <hi>Nicene.</hi> And all the Romane Tradition faÅ¿teneth the InÅ¿titution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon the times of Pope <hi>Mark,</hi> which was about the Year 366. and immediately Å¿ucceeding upon the Councel it Å¿elf. And for the manner of Recitation, <hi>Berno</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>Ille enim ob Arrianorum haereÅ¿in Symbolum Nic num in MiÅ¿Å¿a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58600:145"/> decantari ordinavit, &amp;c</hi> Another Å¿aith, That hee ordained it Å¿hould bee don <hi>AltÃ¢ voce;</hi> And the Å¿ame Father Å¿aith, That by a Canon of the third Councel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> it was ordered concerning the <hi>Creed,</hi> that it Å¿hould bee <hi>paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿im clarÃ¢ voce decantatum, Å¿ecundÃ¹m formam EccleÅ¿iarum Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now out of all this to frame an AnÅ¿wer to the QueÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By all the Orders of BaptiÅ¿m, the <hi>Catechumenus</hi> was firÅ¿t to make his Abrenunciation, to renounce the Divel and all his works. And this hee did with his face turned towards the WeÅ¿t. That don, hee was to turn himÅ¿elf towards the EaÅ¿t, and make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of his Faith in the words of the <hi>Nicene</hi> form (Å¿ince the Councel) But which is principally to bee noted (as to this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s) all this was to bee don <hi>AltÃ¢ voce.</hi> The Church as it received the Form from the order of BaptiÅ¿m, Å¿o it reteined the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture of converÅ¿ion (towards the EaÅ¿t) and manner of pronunciation.</p>
                  <p>So much therefore is certain, that the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> (or what form Å¿oever) was alwaies recited in a different Tone, A louder voice at the leaÅ¿t: but, becauÅ¿ the Canon maketh mention of <hi>Decantari,</hi> and that this was to bee don <hi>Å¿ecundÃ¹m formam EccleÅ¿iarum Orientalium:</hi> Two things will bee granted upon this: One is, That there was a kinde of Modulation in the Pronouncing of the <hi>Creed;</hi> another is, That this was not Romane in the <hi>Original,</hi> but from EaÅ¿tern Example. The Summ of both is, That either the words <hi>dici &amp; decantari</hi> muÅ¿t bee confounded: or that, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Å¿implicitie of time, the pronunciation was made by <hi>Dici,</hi> onely with the difference of <hi>AltÃ¢ voce,</hi> but afterwards graced with a meaÅ¿ure of Harmonie; yet Å¿uch an one, as cannot bee compared higher, then to the matter of Plain-Å¿ong; for I am deceived, if the EaÅ¿tern MuÅ¿ick ever improved further. Antiphones I know they had, and upon what Seraphical occaÅ¿ion, if <hi>Sozomen</hi> deliver it rightly; but this came to no more then our alternation, at the moÅ¿t ordinarie Å¿inging of the PÅ¿alms, by waie of ReÅ¿ponds, but all in the Å¿ame time and tune, &amp; without anie DiÅ¿cant at all.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:58600:145"/>
                  <p>Therefore to Å¿aie all at once. The Singing of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Creed,</hi> as now it is, with all the Ornaments and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Harmonie, is but a YeÅ¿terdaies buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and contemporarie to the <hi>Organ,</hi> but however the Å¿ame <hi>Creed</hi> hath been moÅ¿t certainly Sung according to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time, and at the leaÅ¿t <hi>in plano Cantu,</hi> in a plain Song-faÅ¿hion, ever Å¿ince the date of the Councel it Å¿elf, and for the ReaÅ¿on given out of the Order of BaptiÅ¿m.</p>

                  <p>When the Scripture Å¿peak's of Mens departure from hence, the uÅ¿ual PhraÅ¿e is, not to Å¿aie Å¿uch an one <hi>died;</hi> but, Å¿uch an one <hi>Å¿lept</hi> with his Fathers.

                  <p>When wee go to take our Natural reÅ¿t, wee enter into our Chambers, and Å¿hut the doors. Such a Room as this is the Sepulcher. A Church-yard, in the expreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Antients, was but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Having entered our Chambers, and Å¿hut the door, the next thing wee do, is, to commend our Å¿elvs to God. So the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> when hee was to fall into that other Å¿leep, firÅ¿t Å¿aid his Praiers; <hi>Lord JeÅ¿u receiv my Spirit.</hi>

The Å¿ame fleÅ¿h wee put off the night before; but with this difference, that this Fowl Garment, which could not bee kept UnÅ¿potted of the world, Å¿hall in the mean time bee waÅ¿hed clean in the Blood of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p>Our Clothes put off, wee laie our Å¿elvs down, and take our reÅ¿t: And, to Die, in the Prophet <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi>'s PhraÅ¿e,<note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 43.17. &amp; 57.1.</note> is but to <hi>lie down in our Beds.

                  <p>In the CaÅ¿e of Natural ReÅ¿t, 'tis not the whole man, onely the Earthlie part falleth aÅ¿leep; the Soul is then moÅ¿t awake. The Bodie's Night is the Soul's Daie: our Better part, Å¿aith <hi>Cardan,</hi> is never it's own man till now, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted unto a State of Separation, (as it were) in the bodie, it Å¿pendeth the time in Contemplations, free, and congeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to its own Extraction. So in the Å¿leep of Death, 'tis not the <hi>totus Homo:</hi> the Bodie indeed is dead, becauÅ¿ of Å¿in; the Soul is then moÅ¿t Alive. Here, as a Servant, it is Å¿till
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58600:150"/> required to the Exigencies of the Bodie; having no time of it's own to Å¿pend, but what it can get by Å¿tealth, when the MaÅ¿ter is gon to bed. But there, like it's Redeemer, free among the Dead, and delivered from the Incumbrances of the Bodie, it begineth to bee a Soul to it Å¿elf, minding that which is above, and looking with a more piercing eie upon the InviÅ¿ible things of God.</p>
                  <p>It is noted by the NaturaliÅ¿ts, and wee finde it true in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation, that no noiÅ¿ awaketh Natural Sleep more Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, then an Humane voice: Nay, though it bee that <gap reason="foreign">

But, that wee Å¿hall all bee awaked out of this other Sleep, by the Å¿ound of our Proper Names, is more then I can pretend to: though S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s call was, <hi>Tabitha Å¿urge;</hi> and our Saviour's to his Friend, <hi>Lazare veni foras, Lazarus</hi> com forth. To Å¿aie nothing to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Tradition, that, when our Lord went down into Hell, and there found our Father <hi>Adam</hi> faÅ¿t; hee took him by the hand, and called him by his own Name, in the words of S. <hi>Paul, Surge Adam qui dormis</hi> (Å¿o indeed Å¿om Antient Copies read it,) <hi>AriÅ¿e Adam, thou that Å¿leepeÅ¿t, and Å¿tand up from the dead,</hi> ChriÅ¿t taketh thee by the hand. But this I am Å¿ure of, that wee Å¿hall all bee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a voice, the voice of an Archangel; and the word Å¿hall bee, as Å¿om think, <hi>Surgite mortui, &amp;c.</hi> Nor Å¿hall it bee the voice of a God, and not of a Man; it Å¿hall bee an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane voice: for, by the Archangel, wee are to mean the <hi>Son of Man. For the hour cometh, in which all they that are in the Graves Å¿hall hear his voice, and Å¿hall com forth, Job.</hi> 5.28. Which why it Å¿hould bee Å¿trange of us, I know not; Å¿ince it is true of the Swallows, by a certain and confeÅ¿t Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that when the Winter cometh, they lie down in the hollow of a Tree, and there falling aÅ¿leep, quietly reÅ¿olv into their firÅ¿t Principles: But at the Spring's approach, they are not Å¿o (though throughly) dead, but that they hear the Å¿til noiÅ¿ of Returning Nature, and awaking out of their MaÅ¿s, riÅ¿e up everie one to their life again. <hi>Ego novi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58600:150"/> &amp;c.</hi> I know a man (Å¿aith the Learned Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi>) who, in his Å¿oundeÅ¿t Sleep, could walk, talk, write, and diÅ¿patch anie buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the moÅ¿t required Vigilance. They Å¿eem to have had Å¿om Å¿uch conceit of Death, who hold it no abÅ¿urditie, to write Letters to their dead Friends; as the Emperor <hi>TheodoÅ¿ius</hi> to S. <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tom,</hi> more then thirtie Years after his deceaÅ¿; as if Death were a kinde of live Sleep; Such an one as that, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> Å¿ent of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, to awake <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> And may wee not as properly Å¿aie, that to bee Dead, is to bee Alive; as to Å¿aie, to Die, is to bee Born? And yet the Antients (as if Corruption had been their Father, and the Worms their Mother) were wont to call the daies of their Death, <hi>Natalia,</hi> not Dying, but Birth-daies. <hi>Mos inolevit in Å¿ancta EccleÅ¿ia,</hi> it hath been the cuÅ¿tom in the holie Church, (Å¿aith <hi>Haymo,</hi>) when a Saint of God departed this life, to call it not the daie of his Death, but the daie of his Nativitie. That which wee call Death's, they call Life's door: <hi>Seneca</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿aid as much; <hi>Dies iÅ¿te, quem Tutanquam Supremum reformidas, Aeterni Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eÅ¿t.</hi> As if all this were Å¿o indeed, the <hi>Jews</hi> to this daie, Å¿tick not to call their <hi>Golgotha</hi>'s, <hi>Batte Caiim,</hi> the HouÅ¿es, or places of the Living. At the leaÅ¿t they have an Effectual life in them: for the <hi>Mummies</hi> are known to bee moÅ¿t Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and MagiÅ¿tral in Medicine; and the Principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of the weapon-Salv, is the MoÅ¿s of a dead Man's-skul: as the <hi>Recipe,</hi> delivered by <hi>ParacelÅ¿us</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Once more, and I leav the Parallel.

And the Å¿trangeneÅ¿s hath been quitted by an Experience of later daies. The CompariÅ¿on holdeth in the Sleep of Death: 'tis <hi>Omnibus communis,</hi> common to all men, as wee uÅ¿e to Å¿aie. And yet Å¿om <hi>Jews</hi> believ, that the laÅ¿t age of Men Å¿hall bee Å¿o long liv'd, as to prevent the ReÅ¿urrection; But S. <hi>Paul</hi> himÅ¿elf hath promiÅ¿ed, <gap reason="foreign">

And the Night is no longer, in the Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s account, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 30.5. For, <hi>his Anger endureth but a Moment:</hi> that is, weeping may endure for a Night, but joie cometh in the Morning. 'Tis no otherwiÅ¿e in Death: for, when firÅ¿t wee awake out of this Å¿leep, wee Å¿hall think that wee did but then lie down; and were it a thouÅ¿and Years, it would Å¿eem no more to us, then it doth to God himÅ¿elf; <hi>but as one daie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ObÅ¿ervable, that the Holie GhoÅ¿t, which accounteth Natural Death, as a Sleep, yet calleth the Life of a Sinner by the name of Death. To bee truly Dead, is, to bee Dead in TreÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es and Sins: And therefore S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not making mention of the Great ReÅ¿urrection, bid's his <hi>Corinthians</hi> awake to RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and Å¿in not. For a Righteous man hath more Hope in his Death, then a Sinner in his Life: and no man can bee Dead to Nature, that is Alive to God.</p>
                  <p>But, if to Die bee but to fall AÅ¿leep; wee Å¿hould put off this Garment of FleÅ¿h with as good a will, as wee do our Clothes. And that wee may Å¿leep well in the night, wee Å¿hould forbear Å¿leeping in the Daie, not Idleing in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,

                  </p>
                  <p>But then I am to lead you back to the Old Law, of the <hi>Omer,</hi> or <hi>Sheaf. Levit.</hi> 23.9. Where the Children of IfraÃ«l are commanded, that at the reaping of their HarveÅ¿t no Bread, or Parched Corn, or Green Ears bee eaten in their dwellings, till a Sheaf of the FrÅ¿t Fruits bee offered, and Waved before the Lord, together with a Lamb for a Burnt Offering. The Traditions here (and not unneceÅ¿Å¿arily) Å¿upplie; that, thoÅ¿e who lived far from the Holie Citie, might eat of the New Corn, when Mid-daie was paÅ¿t: for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58600:152"/> that is was preÅ¿umed, the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> would Å¿ee the Sheaf offered up ere that time. Thus the Letter, and Cerimonie: which, how well it is anÅ¿wered in the Truth, and SubÅ¿tance, I Å¿hall briefly Å¿hew you.</p>
                  <p>The Typical Sheaf, (as the Doctors deliver in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi>) was to bee cut down in the Night: So was the <hi>True.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Codmenac.</note> Hee was cut down indeed in the Daie time; but the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s was the greater: for the verie Light of This Daie was DarkneÅ¿s; and therefore how great was that? A dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, that indeed might bee felt. A darkneÅ¿s over the face of the whole Earth: Such an one, as in the Begining was over the face of the Deep, before the Creator had Å¿aid, <hi>Let there bee Light.</hi> And though the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of DarkneÅ¿s till the Ninth hour; yet moÅ¿t certain it is, that That Daie had another DarkneÅ¿s, about the Twelfth hour, of Nature's own ProviÅ¿ion. For, by the AÅ¿tronomical Tables, the Moon was at that time almoÅ¿t totally EclipÅ¿ed: So truly were theÅ¿e FirÅ¿t Fruits cut down in the Night,</p>
                  <p>The Typical Sheaf thus reaped down, was carried into the Court-yard of the Sanctuarie, threÅ¿hed, parched, ground; then lifted up, and waved before the Lord: So was the <hi>True.</hi> The manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> ThreÅ¿hing was by the Treading of Oxen, and Wheels indented with iron teeth. And did not manie Buls compaÅ¿s Him about? And was not Hee <hi>bruiÅ¿ed for our TranÅ¿greÅ¿sions?</hi> His Hands, and his Feet were pierced; and all his Bones were out of joint: they had been broken too, but for the Prophecie. Hee was Parched: for, was not his Å¿trength dried up, as a Pot-Å¿heard? Did not his Tongue cleav to the roof of his Mouth? And was hee not brought down to the duÅ¿t of Death? You may hear him Å¿aie all this himÅ¿elf, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 22. Hee was lifted up too: for, <hi>as MoÅ¿es l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fted up the Serpent in the WilderneÅ¿s, Å¿o was the Son, &amp;c.</hi> And hee was waved too, (as Å¿om compare it) by an Earthquake, at the ReÅ¿urrection. But inÅ¿tead of Waving, the Text tranÅ¿lateth it; The Sheaf was Separated. So were theÅ¿e firÅ¿t Fruits: and the DeÅ¿erti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was Å¿o great, that hee cried out, His God, His God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58600:153"/> him. LaÅ¿tly, there was an Extraordinarie Lamb to bee offered up, as due to the Sheaf. And if one Å¿hould ask us, as once the Son did the Father; <hi>Behold the fire, and the wood; but where is the Lamb for a burnt Offering?</hi> Hee would bee anÅ¿wered, that <hi>God would provide himÅ¿elf a Lamb. Ecce Agnus Dei,</hi> Behold the Lamb of God. But that which moÅ¿t of all concern's is, the Condition of the FirÅ¿t Fruits: That was, till TheÅ¿e were offered up no Man of the Land of IÅ¿rael might eat of his New Corn; 'twas yet Profane, and CurÅ¿ed, as the Ground that bare it. But, the Sheaf once offered up, the whole Crop is intituled to the ConÅ¿ecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, <hi>if the FirÅ¿t Fruits bee holie,</hi> Å¿aith S. <hi>Paul, then Å¿o is alÅ¿o the whole lump.</hi> This alÅ¿o is the caÅ¿e of the ReÅ¿urrection: for, if ChriÅ¿t, the firÅ¿t Fruits, bee riÅ¿en; then They alÅ¿o that are His, the whole Lump, at his Coming. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿t is the end of the World; and the end of our Life is in the Å¿eed time: Church-yards are the Plots; which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the high Dutch moÅ¿t properly term, <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Aeres,</hi> or <hi>Glebe Land,</hi> wherein the Dead are Å¿own a Natural bodie; but the Crop Å¿hall not bee Å¿uch, as wherewith the Mower filleth not his hand, or hee that bindeth up the Sheafs his boÅ¿om. It Å¿hall bee with the Fat of the Kidnies of Wheat, as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in the Song. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. 'Tis Å¿own in DiÅ¿ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; it riÅ¿eth again in Glorie.

                  <p>The FirÅ¿t Fruits beeing riÅ¿en; take anie one of us anie grain of Corn in the whole Lump, and caÅ¿t it into the ground, if it die not, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much Fruit. For the Life of the Lump, like Corn in the Earth, is laied in the FirÅ¿t Fruits in God: The inÅ¿tance of the Corn is Å¿o pregnant, that the Greek Churches, in their Commemorations of the Dead; uÅ¿e to boil Wheat in water, and Å¿et it before them, as a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Symbol of the ReÅ¿urrection.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58600:153"/> that This is the Greater wonder of the two; that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection of the Corn is more Prodigious then that of the Bodie. Strange indeed it is, that a grain of Corn Å¿hould not quicken, except it die: But much more Å¿trange, that out of one grain, and one as good as Dead, Å¿hould Å¿pring forth Å¿uch a Numerous IncreaÅ¿. As for our Bodies, which are Å¿own in Corruption; the Earth, when Å¿hee Å¿hall give up her Dead, will render, but as the Talent hid in the Napkin, the Å¿ame again; or one for another.

Wee uÅ¿e Vulgarly, but Improperly, to call the uppermoÅ¿t of the Branches, the Top of a Tree: but wee are corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>AriÅ¿totle,</hi> in the Books <hi>De Anima;</hi> where wee are taught to call the Root, the Head; and the Top, the Feet. In the ReverÅ¿ of this CompariÅ¿on, the firÅ¿t Fruits are the Root, and the Head; wee, the Branches, or Members. And in the 36. of <hi>IÅ¿aiah,</hi> the Head acknowledgeth the whole departed Race of Mankinde to bee his Trunk, or Dead Bodie. Wee read it: <hi>Thy Dead Men shall ariÅ¿e;</hi> With my dead Bodie Å¿hall they ariÅ¿e. But the reÅ¿t is put in by the TranÅ¿lators: The Original is, <hi>Thy dead Men shall ariÅ¿e:</hi> they Å¿hall ariÅ¿e, my dead Bodie. Seeing therefore that the Ax is not laid to the Root of the Tree, what though the Branches bee lopt off by Death, there is Å¿till Hope in the Tree, Å¿aith Holie <hi>Job.</hi> For though the Stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the Å¿ent of water, 'twill bud and bring forth boughs like a Plant; which withereth over night: but beeing watered with the dew of Heaven, Å¿pring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up afreÅ¿h in the Morning.

But wee are not to give heed unto JewiÅ¿h Fables: and therefore it Å¿hall not bee here enquired, who Å¿hall bee the Father of this Rain; or, Who Å¿hould beget theÅ¿e drops of Dew. Sure wee are, that though touch'd by Death wee Å¿hrink up, like that Å¿enÅ¿itive Plant: yet wee Å¿hall Å¿oon quicken by his Influence, whoÅ¿e <hi>Head</hi> (in the <hi>Canticles) is fill'd with Dew; and his Looks as with the drops of the night.</hi> In Exprobration therefore unto Death, and Mortalitie, wee know whoÅ¿e uÅ¿e it was to burie their dead in their Gardens; Å¿owing their Bodies with as much faith, as their Fruits, and equally exÅ¿pecting the Å¿pring of Both. 'Tis for no other reaÅ¿on, that wee ourÅ¿elvs Å¿tick our HearÅ¿es with Flowers, and go forth to the grave with RoÅ¿emarie. Our Precedents were the Jews, whoÅ¿e antient CuÅ¿tom it was by the waie as they went with their CorpÅ¿es, to pluck everie one up the GraÅ¿s; as who Å¿hould Å¿aie, they were not Å¿orrie, as men without Hope; for, their brother was but Å¿o crop't off, and Å¿hould Å¿pring up again in his due Å¿eaÅ¿on.</p>
                  <p>But the Prophet <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi>'s CompariÅ¿on of the FlouriÅ¿hing of our Bones like an Herb, is yet further made good, by (as I think) one of the greateÅ¿t Secrets, that are yet known in Nature. A Learned ChymiÅ¿t, who Å¿pent much time in the Contemplation of Tinctures, and ImpreÅ¿Å¿ions of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to prove the Great Principle of Salt, made this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. Hee took Å¿everal Herbs, and Plants, and calcined them to AÅ¿hes: hee put up the AÅ¿hes into Å¿everal GlaÅ¿Å¿es, Å¿ealed Hermetically, and written upon with the Å¿everal names of the Calcined Herbs. When hee would Å¿hew the Experiment, hee applied a Å¿oft flame to the GlaÅ¿Å¿es; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthwith hee might perceiv the Å¿elf Å¿ame Herbs riÅ¿ing up by little and little out of the AÅ¿hes, everie one in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form: and, the flame Å¿ubtracted, they would return to their own Chaos again.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58600:154"/>
                  <p>The Spectators, as the ChymiÅ¿t, beheld this with the greateÅ¿t Admiration; and giving thanks to God, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from thence the ReÅ¿urrection of the Dead Bodie.</p>
                  <p>Wee may take an Omen of our RiÅ¿ing again, from the Time of our Saviour's ReÅ¿urrection. The firÅ¿t fruits roÅ¿e in the Spring: and that's the time (Å¿o the Senator <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius</hi>) wherein the Phenix riÅ¿eth out of her aÅ¿hes. And 'tis the time wherein the <hi>Egyptians</hi> celebrate their Annual ReÅ¿urrection: for upon the 26. of March, they Å¿olemnly go to a place by <hi>Nile,</hi> where they Å¿ee, and touch the Bodies RiÅ¿ing out of their Graves. It will Å¿eem Å¿trange, I confeÅ¿s, but it hath been Å¿eriouÅ¿ly teÅ¿tified, and believed. HowÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wee Å¿hall take this, but as a Å¿taff of <hi>Egypt;</hi> a broken Reed, or, but Å¿uch an one, as <hi>Gehazi</hi> laid upon the Dead Childe. But the maÅ¿ter cometh Å¿hortly, and Å¿hall command the Breath to com from the four Winds, and breath upon our Slain; and then theÅ¿e Bones Å¿hall live.</p>
                  <p>But I would not have this Doctrine two partially appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: our Saviour indeed is Å¿aid to bee <hi>the firÅ¿t Fruits of them that Å¿leep</hi> in Him. ThoÅ¿e that Å¿leep in Him, are Å¿uch, which here awake and Å¿tand up from the Death of Å¿in. For, as there is a Å¿econd Death; Å¿o, Here is a firÅ¿t ReÅ¿urrection. In the great morning of the World the Dew Å¿hall fall down upon the dead in ChriÅ¿t; as that other Dew upon the Fleece of <hi>Gideon;</hi> and the reÅ¿t of Mankinde Å¿hall bee drie. But another dew Å¿hall fall upon the ungodlie; a BlaÅ¿ting Mildew: and then the reÅ¿t of the ground Å¿hall bee wet, and the Fleece onely Å¿hall bee drie. <hi>The 'wicked lie in the graves like Sheep,</hi> (Å¿aith the <hi>PÅ¿almiÅ¿t) that are appointed to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Righteous shall have dominion over them in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In the field of the World, where our Saviour is the firÅ¿t Fruits, the Good are the Wheat; and the Bad are the Tares: which as they both are cut down alike, Å¿o Å¿hall they both alike bee gathered up: But the Tares for the Fire; and the good Corn for the great Husbandman's Barn. They Å¿eem indeed to bee of the Lump; but no more title to the FirÅ¿t Fruits, then that, as theÅ¿e were cut down, Å¿o thoÅ¿e were Å¿owed in the Night.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58600:155"/>
                  <p>If theÅ¿e things bee Å¿o, what manner of perÅ¿ons ought wee to bee, in all holie ConverÅ¿ation? But if the ReÅ¿urrection were to bee argued from the Sanctitie of Life; there was never leÅ¿s Hope of it, then now. Nay, wee take the onely courÅ¿ to prove that our Saviour is not yet RiÅ¿en. 'Tis but the ConverÅ¿ion of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s PropoÅ¿ition: <hi>If ChriÅ¿t bee not riÅ¿en; then you are yet in your Å¿ins:</hi> But you are yet in your Å¿ins: and yee know what follow's.</p>

                  <p>In this TranÅ¿lation as now received, beÅ¿ides manie other various Readings, two irreconciliable differences from the Original have paÅ¿Å¿ed, the one purely Chronological by a numerous exceÅ¿s in the Anni <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Monument laie long Buried it Å¿elf under the Seats near the Pulpit, at the removal whereof, it was of late years diÅ¿covered, and tranÅ¿lated from thence to the North part of the <hi>Nave,</hi> where it now lyeth betwixt the Pillars, covered over with a Box of Wood, not without a general imputation of Raritie and Reverence, it Å¿eeming almoÅ¿t

Of the skin they make their Virgin Parchment, a thing of great importance, as to them, and in which all their Spels and Charms are to bee written. Of the FleÅ¿h decocted to a Jellie, they make their Unguents, with which they do things of Å¿o rare and unreaÅ¿onable conÅ¿equence. This practiÅ¿e of theirs as maliciouÅ¿ly bad as it is, yet more and more confeÅ¿Å¿eth to my purpoÅ¿e, the Å¿ecret Å¿trength of Innocencie, and Å¿anctitie of Children.</p>
                     <p>Therefore by the greateÅ¿t right of Nature, theÅ¿e Infants ought to have been proof againÅ¿t the moÅ¿t barbarous and unhappie hand.</p>

                     <p>If this were the reaÅ¿on, it Å¿eemeth a little to reflect upon the matter of the Innocents.</p>
                     <p>But indeed if the Storie had been fully and expreÅ¿ly Å¿et down, it muÅ¿t have gon for nothing. For this is but that <hi>Philo,</hi> which with others of the like pretended Autoritie, <hi>(BeroÅ¿us, MetaÅ¿thenes &amp;c.) Amius</hi> the Monk hath Å¿o lately obtruded to this world. But the impudent forgeries of this fellow, the learned <hi>JoÅ¿eph Scaliger, Sethus CalviÅ¿ius, &amp;c.</hi> have verie quickly and Å¿ufficiently chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>And yet this ignorant Man is as reverently quoted by <hi>Rabbi Azarias</hi> in his <hi>Meor Enaiim,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the Å¿trangeÅ¿t thing indeed is, that <hi>JoÅ¿ephus</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿hould take no notice of this matter, not onely not of the Å¿aying of <hi>AuguÅ¿tus,</hi> but nothing neither of the killing of the children, a PaÅ¿Å¿age verie unexÅ¿pectedly omitted by Å¿o
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58600:169"/> great a Courtier and Å¿o good an HiÅ¿torian, eÅ¿pecially one that Å¿pared not to Å¿et forth the reÅ¿t of <hi>Herod</hi>'s indignities to the full.</p>
                     <p>It is enough to draw Å¿om doubt upon the Tradition of <hi>Macrobius. JoÅ¿eph Scaliger</hi> believeth it all; but yet his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that <hi>AuguÅ¿tus</hi> Å¿hould make Å¿uch a return upon <hi>Herod,</hi> Å¿eeing that hee himÅ¿elf did the Murther, not onely upon this, but upon all the three Å¿ons. I do not perceiv that the Learned Man hath cauÅ¿ enough. <hi>Herod</hi> did but caÅ¿t the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious part upon the Emperor (and officiouÅ¿ly too) but left the main and principal guilt upon his own head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nevertheleÅ¿s, to all this the Emperor might verie fitly retort, as hee did, That it were better to bee <hi>Herod</hi>'s Hog then his Son.</p>
                     <p>But what Å¿on of <hi>Herod</hi>'s could this bee? It muÅ¿t bee <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater;</hi> or it muÅ¿t bee none. But <hi>Antipater</hi> was more a man then to bee reckoned among the children of two years old and under. And moreover then that, <hi>Antipater</hi> was not at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> nor thereabouts at that time.</p>
                     <p>I know not upon what terms to make this hold, unleÅ¿s it may bee thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> had obteined of <hi>AuguÅ¿tus</hi> the killing of two Å¿ons already, and now Å¿olicited for the third. It was preÅ¿ently upon the killing of the Infants that <hi>Herod</hi>'s MeÅ¿Å¿engers came to <hi>Rome</hi> with the AccuÅ¿ations of his Å¿on <hi>Antipater,</hi> and Å¿o both the PaÅ¿Å¿ages came to the Emperors ear at the Å¿ame time, and this later, for the nearneÅ¿s was miÅ¿reckoned into the bargain.</p>
                     <p>There is another CircumÅ¿tance or two, which make the Murther Å¿o much the more concerning.</p>
                     <p>One is,</p>

The Piper (the <hi>Pid'e Piper</hi> they call'd him) came to demand his monie: but the Å¿umm was now thought to bee too much, eÅ¿pecially the thing beeing don Å¿o eaÅ¿ily too, and Å¿o unexÅ¿pectedly: yet they allotted him a good Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reward; but the fellow would have his bargain, all or

                  <p>The Sun's Year is the Revolution of his Motion in the Ecliptick, which if it bee accounted in the Zodiack, it uÅ¿eth to bee called <hi>Annus Temporalis,</hi> becauÅ¿ it Å¿o diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿heth the <hi>quatuor Tempora,</hi> Summer, Winter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is otherwiÅ¿e term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and indeed moÅ¿t properly) <hi>Annus Tropicus</hi> or <hi>vertens,</hi> becauÅ¿ the AÅ¿tronomers of old reckoned this Year from the Tropicks firÅ¿t, as it may Å¿eem, though after alÅ¿o from the Equinoctial's depending upon the Sun's entrance into theÅ¿e Points,<note place="margin">CabaÅ¿il. in <hi>3.</hi> Ptolem.

                     <p>EClipÅ¿ is more properly Å¿aid of the Moon then of the Sun. The EclipÅ¿ of the Moon is cauÅ¿Å¿ed by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition of the Earth. The EclipÅ¿ of the Sun by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58600:184"/> of the Moon, therefore the Sun cannot bee Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed but when hee is in Conjunction with the Moon; nor the Moon, but when Å¿hee is in oppoÅ¿ition to the Sun: yet neither do the EclipÅ¿es com to paÅ¿s, as often as theÅ¿e Lights oppoÅ¿e or conjoin; for then they Å¿hould bee Monethlie: Onely that Conjunction or OppoÅ¿ition maketh an EclipÅ¿ which is Diametral; that is, when the center of the Earth and the centers of both the Luminaries Å¿hall bee in the Å¿ame line, which hapneth to bee there onely, where the Moon's Eccentrick cutteth the Sun's in that Line, which is therefore called the Ecliptick. This interÅ¿ection is (as needs it muÅ¿t) but in two places, called by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the <hi>Nodi,</hi> one aÅ¿Å¿cending, the other deÅ¿cending. The Arabians term them the Dragon's Head and Tail, from the faÅ¿hion of the InterÅ¿ections as they imagine it. But neither do theÅ¿e Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ections keep one certain place, but moving make a Circle of 18 Years, Å¿o that the EclipÅ¿ of the Moon which Å¿hall fall out the tenth of <hi>December</hi> next, in the 20 deg. of Gemini, Å¿hall 18 Years hence com to paÅ¿s in the Å¿ame Sign again.</p>
                     <p>Therefore EclipÅ¿es beeing Periodical, the begining of the World Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, the AÅ¿tronomer by Calculation can attein to anie, and all that ever have been by the Å¿ame Rules, by which hee foretelleth thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall bee Å¿o, that if anie where in Storie this Character Å¿hall occurr, nothing can more aÅ¿Å¿ure the Time.</p>
                     <p>Let InÅ¿tance bee made in the Begining of the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the appointment whereof dependeth upon the Battel at <hi>Arbela,</hi> or (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> correcteth) at <hi>Gaugamele.</hi> Eleven daies (Å¿aith the Å¿ame Autor) before this fight an EclipÅ¿ of the Moon was Å¿een. 'Twas the Å¿econd hour of the Night, Å¿aith <hi>Plinie,</hi> the Moon then riÅ¿ing in <hi>Sicilie.</hi> AÅ¿tronomical calculation demonÅ¿trateth that this EclipÅ¿ (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered) could not fall out but in the Å¿econd Year of the 112 Olympiad, which was the 3619 of the World, the Sun beeing then in the 24 deg. of Virgo. And therefore that God in <hi>Cicero</hi> miÅ¿took the courÅ¿ of the Stars, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aged,<note place="margin">Cic. de. Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                        </note> For Å¿uch is the aÅ¿Å¿urance of this Character, that though the AÅ¿tronomer learn of the HiÅ¿torian, that there was an EclipÅ¿; yet where, and oft-times when it was, the HiÅ¿torian might learn of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>EuÅ¿ebius</hi> and <hi>Dio</hi> Å¿et down that there was an EclipÅ¿ of the Sun a little before the death of <hi>AuguÅ¿tus;</hi> but by a Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on AÅ¿tronomical, the EclipÅ¿ was not of the Sun but of the Moon, nor was it a little before, but a little after his death.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reporteth, that in his time (about the Year of ChriÅ¿t 393) Å¿o terrible a darkneÅ¿s overÅ¿hadowed the earth <hi>(obÅ¿curato Å¿ole)</hi> that everie man thought the World was at an end. <hi>Nos Å¿cindimus EccleÅ¿iam</hi> (Å¿aith hee to <hi>Pammachius) qui ante paucos menÅ¿es, circa dies PentecoÅ¿tes, cum obÅ¿curato Sole omnis Mundus jam jÃ¡mque venturum Judicem formidaret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the AÅ¿tronomers finde that there could bee no EclipÅ¿ of the Sun then, nor near about that time; but in Å¿uch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es they anÅ¿wer, that the InterpoÅ¿ition was made by Å¿om un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uÅ¿ual exhalations, of that opacitie, which might intercept the Sun's light, in as great a meaÅ¿ure as if the Moon had com between; Such an one was that EclipÅ¿ (as Å¿om HiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians miÅ¿cal it) which was Å¿een Å¿o often in one Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>CeÅ¿ar's</hi> death, and that of the Year 798, the Sun bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿o dark for 18 daies together, <hi>ut naves in mari aberrarent,</hi>

                        </note> which was a greater EclipÅ¿ then the Moon could make.</p>
                     <p>Yet neither is it here to bee diÅ¿Å¿embled that the AÅ¿trono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themÅ¿elvs do not alwaies agree about this infallible Character, for <hi>Moller</hi> findeth out, by his <hi>FriÅ¿ian</hi> Tables, manie EclipÅ¿es which cannot bee attein'd unto by the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenick Tables, or thoÅ¿e of the King <hi>AlphonÅ¿us, &amp;c.</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e this, wee are to laie an imputation upon their Tables, as beeing not all exacted from the Å¿ame HypotheÅ¿es, or not performed with like elaborate erection: Or otherwiÅ¿e wee are to Å¿aie (Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the Tables to bee exact) that Å¿om er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was committed in the calculation of the EclipÅ¿. And in this caÅ¿e wee are to guid our Å¿elvs by the greateÅ¿t Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters in the Art. For what if <hi>Moller</hi> Å¿aie that the Year of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58600:185"/> 
                        <hi>CeÅ¿ar AuguÅ¿tus</hi> his diÅ¿eaÅ¿ cannot bee demonÅ¿trated by the EclipÅ¿ of the Moon in the begining of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> becauÅ¿ the Moon was EclipÅ¿ed both the Year before and after. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus CalviÅ¿ius</hi> may Å¿atisfie, that neither of thoÅ¿e could bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as this was, and whereas the one of thoÅ¿e was Å¿een at 7, the other at 8 of the Clock at night, this was Å¿een at 5 in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>And therefore all this notwithÅ¿tanding, the Character is to bee accounted excellent and of Å¿ingular importance, which <hi>AriÅ¿totle</hi> himÅ¿elf, not ignorant of, appointed <hi>CaliÅ¿the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> at the Å¿iege of Babylon, to reÅ¿erv with all poÅ¿Å¿ible care the <gap reason="foreign">

And the care was taken, yet none of theÅ¿e obÅ¿ervations (though known to bee very manie) could eÅ¿cape the injurie of time, Å¿ave onely three EclipÅ¿es, which came to <hi>Ptolomie</hi>'s hands, unto which, himÅ¿elf added three more of his own obÅ¿ervation, Å¿erving very much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of HiÅ¿torical Truth, though this bee but a Å¿mall number, in compariÅ¿on of thoÅ¿e manie which the HiÅ¿tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here and there have committed to Memorie; for indeed wee are not for this matter, much leÅ¿s beholden to ignorance then to knowledg. Wee know when it was that a Romane General durÅ¿t not give Battel for fear of an EclipÅ¿: and that of the Moon in the begining of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">Tacitus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> can tel us, affrightned the mutinous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into order and accord: And 'tis not long Å¿ince the Conqueror of the Indies perÅ¿uaded the Natives, that hee had complained of them to their Moon, and that Å¿uch a daie the God Å¿hould frown upon them, which was nothing elÅ¿ but an EclipÅ¿, which hee had found out in his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack.</p>
                     <p>However this ignorant Admiration was an occaÅ¿ion to the Men of thoÅ¿e daies, not to leav Å¿o Å¿trange an Accident, as an EclipÅ¿ out of their Storie, eÅ¿pecially if it happened to bee great, or concurring with anie notable deÅ¿ign: little aiming at that which the reach of thoÅ¿e daies hath brought to paÅ¿s upon them, which by turning over the leavs of that celeÅ¿tial volume, recovereth their EclipÅ¿es again; and by

                     <p>THe diviÅ¿ion of the Year into 52 Weeks, becauÅ¿ it Å¿etteth off one daie Å¿upernumerarie, maketh an alteration in all the reÅ¿t; Å¿o that the daies of the Week (which uÅ¿e to bee aÅ¿Å¿igned by the letters of the Alphabet) fall not alike in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years; but Sundaie this Year, muÅ¿t fall out upon the next Year's Mondaie, and Å¿o forwards till Å¿even Years; and (becauÅ¿ the BiÅ¿Å¿extile Å¿uperaddeth another daie everie fourth Year) till four times Å¿even, that is twentie eight Years bee gon about. This Revolution is called the Cycle of the Sun taking name from Sundaie, the Letter whereof (called therefore Dominical) it appointeth for everie year.

                     <p>For becauÅ¿ of the Sun and Moon's unequal motions, the changes falling out inconÅ¿tantly, the time of Conjunction could not bee Å¿till the Å¿ame.

This Cycle is therefore called <hi>Cyclus decennovennalis,</hi> and from the Autor <hi>Annus Metonicus,</hi> from whoÅ¿e <hi>Athenians</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> may Å¿eem to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> from them, in letters of gold; from whence, (if not from the more pretious uÅ¿e of it) it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd to bee call'd,<note place="margin">Origan.</note> as yet Å¿till it is, the <hi>Numerus Aureus,</hi> or Golden Number.

It Å¿elf is found by adding an unite to the year of our Lord, and dividing the whole by 19, the remainder Å¿hall bee the Cycle of the Moon, or if nothing remain, the Cycle is out, that is nineteen.</p>

                        <hi>COnjunctio Å¿uperiorum</hi> is not the Å¿ame thing now as of old. The antient AÅ¿trologers called no Conjunction great but that of <hi>trium Superiorum,</hi> when <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> met altogether. But the later finding the effects of the two conjoined more Å¿trong and prevailing then of the three; have given the name of a great Conjunction onely to that of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e two Å¿uperior Planets finiÅ¿hing their Circles in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal time, they make three Conjunctions in the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. The twelv Signs in AÅ¿trologie are divided into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58600:187"/> four Trigons, or Triplicities, each denominated from the connatural Element; and Å¿o they are three Fierie, three AÃ«<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, three Waterie, and three Earthie. Nineteen years, and Å¿om odd daies and hours gon about, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> meet together in Signs of the Å¿ame Triplicitie: 198 years gon about they meet in Å¿igns of Å¿everal Triplicitie, but not altogether in complying: 794 years and 214 daies gon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout they meet in Signs of contrarie Triplicitie. The firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e is called <hi>Conjunctio Minor;</hi> the Å¿econd <hi>Media.</hi> This latter <hi>Magna,</hi> the great Conjunction, when <hi>Saturn</hi> joineth force with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the fierie Trigon or Triplicitie, which though it happen in 794 years, and 214 daies, yet it uÅ¿eth to bee accounted by the <hi>Numerus rotundus</hi> of 800.</p>
                     <p>By theÅ¿e Conjunctions, Cardinal <hi>Aliac</hi> undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the whole State of Chronologie, and make infallible demonÅ¿tration of the years of the World.</p>
                     <p>To bring this about, hee firÅ¿t of all Å¿uppoÅ¿ed out of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumazar</hi> the figure of Heaven when the World began: That the HoroÅ¿cope was in the Å¿eventh of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and that the Sun was in the 19 of Aries, the reÅ¿t of the Planets accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly aÅ¿Å¿igned.</p>
                     <p>This taken for granted, hee brought himÅ¿elf to that firÅ¿t and great Conjunction, which falling out in the waterie Triplicitie, inÅ¿inuated Å¿uch an influence into the Inferior bodies, as brought upon the World that univerÅ¿al Deluge, as <hi>Aoniar,</hi> and <hi>Albumazar</hi> delivered out of their Antients. By this Conjunction hee aÅ¿Å¿igned 2242 years for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val betwixt the Flood, and the begining of things, but which was neither true in it Å¿elf, nor following his own Principles. And therefore wee may imagine what Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion hee was likely to make, whoÅ¿e foundation was not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appointed: though otherwiÅ¿e a great Conjunction may bee Å¿et down among the Characters of Chronologie; but rather to aÅ¿Å¿ure, then to finde out the moments of time; and more concerning that which is to com, then thoÅ¿e which are gon and paÅ¿t.</p>

                     <p>The Jubiles though by InÅ¿titution begining at the 2500 year from the CreÃ¤tion, yet are Proleptically reckoned from the begining of the world; which alÅ¿o was conÅ¿idered by the Autor, for the firÅ¿t year of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> his firÅ¿t Jubile, was the laÅ¿t of the 51 Jubile from the Worlds CreÃ¤tion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the Autumn where the Jubiles begin.</p>
                     <p>If it bee Å¿aid that Å¿uch or Å¿uch a thing was don in a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year, 'tis a very good Character in the JewiÅ¿h Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58600:190"/> which it meaÅ¿ureth, and <hi>Scaligeri,</hi> from the laÅ¿t Hand.</p>
                     <p>The admirable condition of this Period is to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h everie year within the whole Circle, by a Å¿everal certain Character: for, as in that of <hi>DionyÅ¿ius,</hi> Let the Cycle of the Sun bee 2, and the Moon 3, or whatÅ¿oever, in what year Å¿oever; the Å¿ame never had, nor never again could fall out within the Å¿pace of time: Å¿o in this of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> let the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Moon bee 5, that of the Sun 23. Let the Indicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee 6, as it falleth out this preÅ¿ent year 1638. I Å¿aie the Å¿ame Characters Å¿hall not again concurr till the revolution of 7980 years bee gon about.</p>
                     <p>This Period the Autor fixed in the <hi>Tohu,</hi> or eternal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os of the World, 764 <hi>Julian</hi> years before the moÅ¿t reputed time of CreÃ¤tion, Å¿o that the Circle is not yet out, but Å¿hall bee the 3267 of the Incarnation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far they agree, that the Citie was taken either <hi>Anno</hi> 1452, or elÅ¿ 1453, <hi>poÅ¿t Ch. Nat.</hi> they agree alÅ¿o for the moÅ¿t part, that it was taken the 29 of <hi>Maie, feriÃ¢</hi> 3.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I Å¿aie that the year 1452 had 5 for the Circle of the Sun, therefore the 29 of <hi>Maie</hi> could not that year fall upon TueÅ¿daie, but the daie before, therefore either the Citie was taken the year 1453, or elÅ¿ it was not taken the 29 of <hi>Maie;</hi> but they all agree that it was taken that daie, therefore it was taken that year, by the Circle of the Sun. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o the Å¿tate of the Citie Å¿tood 425 years longer then <hi>Valens</hi> the AÅ¿trologer foretold, who beeing demanded concerning the fate of <hi>ConÅ¿tantinople,</hi> erected the Figure of Heaven for the Nativitie thereof.

                     <p>The Character of Indictions of what importance it is, that therefore abÅ¿olute Chronicle of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> can teÅ¿tifie. <hi>Quod cÃ¹m Å¿ingulis Collegiis conÅ¿ulum</hi> (Å¿aith <hi>Scaliger) Å¿uas Indictiones reddat, nihil habemus hodie perfectius in eo genere. de Emend.

Therefore the year before the Å¿ixth ConÅ¿ulÅ¿hip of <hi>Honorius</hi> was the year of ChriÅ¿t 403, therefore the Å¿ixth ConÅ¿ulÅ¿hip of <hi>Honorius</hi> was the year 404; and therefore the Å¿econd of <hi>Stilico</hi> was 405. In this demonÅ¿tration the three Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters all concurr, but not periodically, yet to the making up of a Å¿trange Truth; for by this it will follow, that hee which inÅ¿crib'd the Tomb did not know the ConÅ¿ul's name, though hee lived at the Å¿ame time. <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore. <hi>QuÃ m barbari Å¿unt &amp; impuri</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>qui doctrinam Cyclorum irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

                     <p>And to put all out of doubt, <hi>CenÅ¿orinus</hi> Å¿aith that the 986 Year of <hi>NobonaÅ¿Å¿ar</hi> was the 238 of ChriÅ¿t, but that was the 4951 of the Julian Period.

                     <p>This <hi>Aera</hi> Å¿till accounteth by <hi>Epyptian</hi> years, which are therefore called <hi>Anni NabonaÅ¿Å¿arei,</hi> and becauÅ¿ it began upon WedneÅ¿daie, the firÅ¿t daie of their firÅ¿t Moneth, which (as the daie it Å¿elf) they hold holie to <hi>Thoth</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi>) uÅ¿eth to bee called <hi>NabonaÅ¿Å¿ar</hi>'s <hi>Thoth.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Aera of the Olympiads.</head>
                     <p>THe Olympick Games were inÅ¿tituted for the exerciÅ¿e of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth, by <hi>Hercules</hi> (as the Tradition go's) to the honor of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> near unto whoÅ¿e Temple they were perform'd in the Olympian field. The ExerciÅ¿e was called <hi>Pentathlon,</hi> or <hi>Quinquertium,</hi> from the fivefold kinde. The Victor was crowned with an Olive, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly carried in a Chariot into his own Citie, and, which is to the purpoÅ¿e, his name was publickly recorded.</p>
                     <p>The time was (as onely <hi>Pindar</hi> hath revealed) at the full Moon which followed the Summer SolÅ¿tice. They were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated everie fifth year; and the Interval was called an Olympiad, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of 4 Julian years, and the odd BiÅ¿Å¿ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile daie, which was the cauÅ¿, as Å¿om think, why this form of year was firÅ¿t introduced.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t Celebration by <hi>Hercules</hi> vaniÅ¿hing in the IntermiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, grew to bee leÅ¿s famous then the reÅ¿titution by <hi>Iphitus,</hi> whereof Å¿o much more notice hath been taken then of the other, that this which was manie years after, is yet account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the firÅ¿t Olympiad. The time or <hi>Aera</hi> whereof is aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ured by the Character of that extraordinarie EclipÅ¿, which the Sun Å¿uffered with our Saviour, noted by <hi>Phlegon</hi> to have happened in the 202 Olympiad, which multiplied by four maketh 808 years, between the firÅ¿t Olympiad, and the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides that, <hi>Thucydides</hi> reporteth that in the firÅ¿t year of the <hi>PeloponneÅ¿iack</hi> War, on a Å¿ummer's daie in the afternoon, there hapned an EclipÅ¿ of the Sun, Å¿o great an one, as that the Stars appeared. This EclipÅ¿, by AÅ¿tronomical Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is found to bee the Å¿econd daie of <hi>Julie,</hi> in the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ChriÅ¿t 463, at which time (as <hi>CruÅ¿ius</hi> calculateth) the Sun was EclipÅ¿ed in the 6 of Leo, half an hour after 5 in the afternoon, the digits of the EclipÅ¿ were 9, and four third parts, therefore almoÅ¿t one fourth part of the Sun was viÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58600:195"/> reÅ¿pecting the Horizon of <hi>Athens,</hi> but in <hi>Thrace</hi> the EclipÅ¿ was well nigh total; Å¿o that the Stars were Å¿een.</p>
                     <p>This therefore was that EclipÅ¿ which <hi>Thucydides</hi> Å¿aith was Å¿een in the firÅ¿t year of the <hi>PeloponneÅ¿iack</hi> war.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth Year of the Å¿ame War, the Å¿ame Autor Å¿aith that <hi>Donius Rhodius</hi> wan the Prize in the Olympicks, and this was the fourth year of the 87 Olympiad, and that was the 460 year before ChriÅ¿t. If therefore the 87 Olympiads bee multiplied by 4, they becom 348 Julian years, which if they bee added to 460, the total will bee as before, 808 years, or the 202 Olympiad before the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>Again <hi>Thucydides</hi> reporteth, that in the 19 year of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneÅ¿iack</hi> War, the Moon was EclipÅ¿ed, and this was as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> relateth in the fourth year of the 91 Olympiad. That EclipÅ¿ of the Moon, as <hi>CruÅ¿ius</hi> calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, fell out upon the 27 daie of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> in the 445 year before the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t. If therefore 90 Olympiads bee multiplied by 4, they make up 360 Julian years, to which alÅ¿o muÅ¿t bee added the three firÅ¿t years of the 91 Olympiad, and then they are 363, which added to 445, make up 808 years before the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of our Saviour, which falleth with the 3173 year of the World, and is the <hi>Aera</hi> of the Olympiads.</p>

                     <p>For the firÅ¿t EclipÅ¿, as his Tables (which are Å¿aid to bee thoÅ¿e of <hi>Hipparchus</hi>) directed him, it fell out in the firÅ¿t year of the Å¿econd Olympiad, upon the 23 daie of the Moneth <hi>Choeac,</hi> which anÅ¿wereth to the 24 of June at three a clock in the morning. Yet according to <hi>Tyche, Ptolomie</hi>'s, and the King <hi>AlphonÅ¿us</hi> their Tables, the latitude was then Å¿o great that there could bee no EclipÅ¿ at that time. So <hi>Sethus Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ius</hi> and others. <hi>Nicolas Muller</hi> pretended, that this EclipÅ¿ could not bee found out by the <hi>Prutenick</hi> Tables, but by the <hi>FriÅ¿ian,</hi> which hee was then about (his own and more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate) hee promiÅ¿eth to account for it. <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> anÅ¿wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the <hi>Prutenick</hi> Tables according to <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheÅ¿es were moÅ¿t exactly performed, and that hee doubted <hi>Muller</hi> could not Å¿tand to his word. Yet Å¿ince that <hi>Muller</hi> hath calculated this EclipÅ¿, and found it to bee by his <hi>FriÅ¿ian</hi> Tables, according as the AÅ¿trologer Å¿et down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henrie Bunting</hi> findeth it in the Å¿econd year of the Å¿econd Olympiad, one year later then the <hi>AÅ¿trologer.</hi> And this may Å¿eem to bee nothing out of the waie. For <hi>DionyÅ¿ius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naÅ¿sius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Romulus</hi> as hee came not into the world, Å¿o hee went not out without an EclipÅ¿. Now <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> reigned 37 years, at which verie time the Sun was EclipÅ¿ed, upon Saturdaie the 26 of <hi>Maie</hi> about 7 of the clock in the afternoon<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the Sun then Å¿etting at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the greateÅ¿t abÅ¿urditie <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> could finde in this was, that it Å¿etteth off but 18 years for the age of <hi>Romulus</hi> at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Rome;</hi> which as hee think's could not make him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enough for the importance of this undertaking; but conÅ¿idering all other circumÅ¿tances agree Å¿o well, the Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is unjuÅ¿t enough.</p>
                     <p>For the other EclipÅ¿ pretended to bee at the Foundation of the Citie. <hi>Nicolas Muller</hi> findeth that alÅ¿o in his <hi>FriÅ¿ian</hi> tables, yet confeÅ¿Å¿eth it could not bee Å¿een at <hi>Rome;</hi> but in <hi>AÅ¿ia</hi> 'twas viÅ¿ible hee Å¿aith, and Å¿o might bee known to <hi>Antimachus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this maketh Å¿omthing for the AÅ¿trologer, who (as <hi>Cicero</hi> citeth him) found the Moon at the Foundation in

                        <hi>Jugo,</hi> that is, as <hi>Solin</hi> may Å¿eem to interpret it, in <hi>Libra;</hi> the rather, becauÅ¿ the PoÃ«t <hi>Manilius</hi> Å¿aith, that <hi>Rome</hi> was built in <hi>Libra.</hi> So <hi>Petavius:</hi> but <hi>Solinus</hi> (though hee knew not what hee Å¿aid) yet Å¿aith too, That the Sun was then in <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is demonÅ¿trated by <hi>Bunting,</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that it was in the twentieth degree; and therefore the more learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> and his <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> interpret the AÅ¿tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers in <hi>Jugo,</hi> to bee the Å¿ame which is now Å¿aid in <hi>Nodo,</hi> which is as much as to Å¿ay, that the Sun and Moon were then in Conjunction, as <hi>Muller</hi> Å¿aith well, and that the Sun was <hi>intra terminos Eclipticos,</hi> within the Ecliptick terms at <hi>Rome,</hi> but not Å¿o far as to make the defection viÅ¿ible in that Horizon.</p>
                     <p>HowÅ¿oever the AÅ¿trologer according to his Calculation Å¿et down that <hi>Rome</hi> was built in the third year of the Å¿ixth Olympiad, which <hi>Terence Varro</hi> took for his reÅ¿olution; and Å¿o reckoned from the Regifugium to the <hi>Palilia</hi> 244 years; <hi>Marcus Cicero, Titus Pomponius Atticus</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>AuguÅ¿tus</hi> approving the EpilogiÅ¿ms, and beÅ¿ides them <hi>Plutarch, Plinie, Paterculus</hi> and others, and 'twas the received opinion; and is infallibly demonÅ¿trated in <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie, by eight Å¿everal celeÅ¿tial Characters or EclipÅ¿es, which calculated to <hi>NabonaÅ¿Å¿ar's Aera</hi> fall even with the AÅ¿trologer. To Å¿ay nothing of <hi>CruÅ¿ius,</hi> who hath don Å¿omthing to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e, or <hi>Peter Appian,</hi> who evinceth the Å¿ame (I Å¿aie not how truely) out of the Figure of the Heavens, which <hi>Turnus</hi> found (but as <hi>Julius Solinus</hi> deÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it) at the laying of the Foundation, <hi>Verrius Flaccus</hi> in the <hi>FaÅ¿ti Capitolini</hi> Å¿etteth down <hi>Rome</hi> built in the fourth year of the Å¿ixth Olympiad, one year later; and the Canons of <hi>EratoÅ¿thenes</hi> in the firÅ¿t year of the Å¿eventh Olympiad one year more, or rather but one in all; for the RegiÅ¿ters of the Capitol agree with <hi>Cato,</hi> and hee differeth nothing from <hi>Varro,</hi> if <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> may bee Judge.</p>

                     <p>THis <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed by the Angel <hi>Gabriel, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Weeks</hi> (Å¿aith hee to the Prophet) <hi>are determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verÅ¿</hi> 24. <hi>Know therefore and underÅ¿tand, that from the going forth of the Commandment, to restore and build Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem unto the MeÅ¿Å¿iah the Prince, Å¿hall bee Å¿even Weeks, and threeÅ¿core and two Weeks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And after threeÅ¿core and two Weeks Å¿hall MeÅ¿Å¿iah bee cut off, but not for himÅ¿elf; and the people of the Prince that Å¿hall com Å¿hall deÅ¿troy the Citie and the Sanctuarie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And hee Å¿hall confirm the Covenant with manie for one Week, and in the midÅ¿t of the Week hee Å¿hall cauÅ¿ the Sacrifice and the Oblation to ceaÅ¿, and for the overÅ¿preading of abominations hee Å¿hall make it deÅ¿olate, even until the conÅ¿ummation, &amp;c.</hi> So the Angel.</p>
                     <p>The Weeks are to bee underÅ¿tood not of daies, but Years; and thoÅ¿e not of the Moon, but the Sun; and Å¿o 70 by 7 is 490 years, from the time of the going forth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment &amp;c. unto the Abomination of deÅ¿olation. But where to begin or end this EpilogiÅ¿m, is the <hi>vexata QuaeÅ¿tio,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> cal's it, a queÅ¿tion that hath endured the greateÅ¿t controverÅ¿ie, involved with circumÅ¿tances of Å¿uch notable intricacie, that a Scholar of verie great parts ('tis reported by one that knew the man) fell mad with Å¿tudying how to make this good.</p>
                     <p>Som reckon the EpilogiÅ¿m from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> others from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius HyÅ¿taÅ¿pis,</hi> and Å¿om from the Å¿eventh, others from the 20 of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> accordingly ending the Weeks, Å¿om at the profanation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> others at the deÅ¿truction of the Temple by <hi>Pompey,</hi> or that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> or elÅ¿ at the PaÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
                     <p>The trueÅ¿t of the falÅ¿, is that which begineth at the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> and endeth in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58600:197"/> PaÅ¿Å¿ion: for this maketh a good account of the years. It was the opinion of the learned <hi>Bunting, Funccius,</hi> &amp;c. but that which I perceiv to bee reÅ¿ted upon, is the judgment of <hi>Scaliger</hi> followed by <hi>CalviÅ¿ius,</hi> and this begineth the Epilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿m at the Å¿econd year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and determineth it in the final deÅ¿truction of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> by <hi>Titus.</hi> For the Angel Å¿aith expreÅ¿ly, that <hi>after Å¿even Weeks and Å¿ixtie two weeks, the MeÅ¿Å¿iah beeing cut off, the holie Citie Å¿hall bee deÅ¿troied &amp;c. and that in the middle of the Å¿eventieth week the Sacrifice and Oblation Å¿hall ceaÅ¿, and for an overÅ¿preading of abomination,</hi> &amp;c. which is plainly called by our Saviour, <hi>the abomination of deÅ¿olation, Å¿poken of by Daniel the Prophet &amp;c.</hi> and therefore no queÅ¿tion, but the feventie Weeks are to end with the Holie Citie. Their begining was to bee from the time of the going forth of the Commandment, &amp;c. And this, though Å¿uch an one was given firÅ¿t by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and thirdly by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> yet moÅ¿t purpoÅ¿ely from <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> in the Å¿econd year of his reign.

The Cycle of the Sun was 6 and the Moon 15. And the Interval is expreÅ¿sly 490 years. For the Holie Citie was deÅ¿troyed in the Å¿eventieth year of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, which was the 4019 from the Worlds CreÃ¤tion, and the 4783 of the Julian Period; the Cycle of the Sun was 23, and the Moon 14.</p>

                     <p>Therefore this <hi>Aera</hi> was fixed in the 4402 of the Julian Period, which was the 3638 from the world's CreÃ¤tion; the Cycle of the Sun was 6, and the Moon 13.

Their concluÅ¿ion therefore was, that our Saviour was born the Å¿ixth of <hi>Januarie,</hi> which how conÅ¿equent it is I need not Å¿aie.

                     <p>The fourth year of the 22 Olympiad anÅ¿wereth to the 19 of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the 33 of the Nativitie, which was the 4745 of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and 3982 of the World, in the 78 <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> year, and 780 of <hi>NabonaÅ¿Å¿ar;</hi> and becauÅ¿ it was <hi>feria Å¿exta,</hi> therefore it was the third daie of <hi>April,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the verie Å¿ame daie a natural EclipÅ¿ of the Moon in the 11 of <hi>Libra,</hi> which began at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> at 5 of the clock and 49 minutes in the afternoon.

                     <p>The <hi>PerÅ¿ians</hi> begin their year at the Vernal Aequinox ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately obÅ¿erving the Sun's entrance into the firÅ¿t point of <hi>Aries,</hi> which daie they call <hi>Neuruz,</hi> that is, <hi>Novus dies;</hi> from <hi>ruz,</hi> which in their tongue Å¿ignifieth a daie, and <hi>Neu, novus,</hi> new; entertaining this time with great Å¿olemnitie, which they hold Å¿o Å¿acred, that no Matrimonie there is accounted legitimate if not contracted in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauÅ¿ the Aegyptian year, to which that <hi>Aera</hi> did applie, Å¿till anticipated the Sun's motion, and gave an unjuÅ¿t account of the Equinox, the Sultan of <hi>CoraÅ¿an</hi> or <hi>MeÅ¿opota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> appointed eight of the moÅ¿t learned AÅ¿trologers of that age (amongÅ¿t whom <hi>Aben Å¿ina</hi> or <hi>Avicen</hi> was one) to make an exact determination of the Tropical year, which was don as they could.

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> What is Proleptical, and what HiÅ¿torical Time.</head>
                     <p>HIÅ¿torical Time is that which is deduced from the <hi>Aera Orbis Conditi.</hi> Proleptical is that which is fixed in the Chaos: The <hi>Jews</hi> call it <hi>tempus Tohu,</hi> as the Chaos is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their <hi>MoÅ¿es, Gen.</hi> 1. So the new Moon which they Å¿uppoÅ¿e to bee upon the Å¿econd of the fix daies, that is, if the Luminaries had then been, they call <hi>Novilunium Tohu,</hi> for that as yet there was neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t example of Proleptical Time was given by the Greek Church, who in their Computations follow the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture of the Septuagint. Therefore their <hi>Aera Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Conditi</hi> is Å¿ixed in 5500 year <hi>Ante ChriÅ¿tum Natum.</hi> Their more Artificial men, perceiving that this vaÅ¿t EpilogiÅ¿m was good for Å¿omwhat elÅ¿, beÅ¿ides the meaÅ¿uring of Times, applied it to the Characters, and they found that divided by 19 and 28, it gave the Circle of the Sun and Moon, but divided by 15 it gave not the true Indiction; therefore they added 8 to the Å¿umm, and Å¿o it became a Technical or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Period, comprehending the three Characters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿ it Å¿uppoÅ¿ed 8 years of the <hi>Tohu,</hi> it was Proleptical; but which the Times following not conÅ¿idering reckoned HiÅ¿torically, as if the <hi>Aera Orbis</hi> had then been fixed; but are thus to bee corrected.</p>
                     <p>This Account is uÅ¿ed by the <hi>Maronites, Grecians,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the EaÅ¿tern Church, it is called <hi>Aera Graecorum,</hi> or more properly <hi>Periodus ConÅ¿tantinopolitana,</hi> from the Seat of the Empire, where it may Å¿eem to have been deviÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>By this Example <hi>Scaliger</hi> made up his <hi>Julian</hi> Period, which it Å¿elf alÅ¿o, as this, conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of Time, partly HiÅ¿tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and partly proleptical.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> ConÅ¿idering the CauÅ¿Å¿es of that infinite Varietie which is found to bee amongÅ¿t Chronologers.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FRederick HuÅ¿man</hi> in his EpiÅ¿tle to the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> reckoneth up 40 Å¿everal Opinions concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of thoÅ¿e two famous <hi>Aera</hi>'s; this of <hi>Christi Nati,</hi> and that other of <hi>Orbis Conditi.</hi> And I doubt not but this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿itie might bee redoubled if anie bodie would undertake that Å¿uch frivolous pains.</p>
                     <p>The extremeÅ¿t varietie is that of the Greek and Hebrew Scripture, making a difference of two thouÅ¿and years; an occaÅ¿ion juÅ¿tly taken by Å¿om equally to diÅ¿parage the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie either of the one or the other. For it cannot bee but that this EpilogiÅ¿m muÅ¿t bee detracted from the Hebrew, or Å¿uperadded to the Greek, there beeing no mean waie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. But certainly, the Hebrew (though I hold it not Å¿o everie waies incorrupt, as if not one jot or title of the Å¿ame Å¿uffered the common fate of time) yet I believ it to bee the Original, and by the incredible diligence of the <hi>MaÅ¿ora,</hi> Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to the greater providence of God, to retain more of it's own puritie, then anie other Scripture whatÅ¿oever; and therefore that it reÅ¿teth in the Greek TranÅ¿lation, to account for this difference: yet neither do I think that choice AÅ¿Å¿emblie Å¿o neglected by God in a matter Å¿o importantly cared for by him, as to recede Å¿o fouly from their Original.</p>
                     <p>I rather caÅ¿t this corruption upon the dregs of Time, aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uring my Å¿elf that this impoÅ¿ture was put upon us by the HelleniÅ¿ts, thoÅ¿e among them who affected that antient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie of the ChiliaÅ¿ts; the conceit whereof I affirm to bee the occaÅ¿ion of this corruption.</p>
                     <p>Other differences in that Connexion have theÅ¿e leÅ¿Å¿er CauÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
                     <p>That profane HiÅ¿torie maketh no certain account of Time before the Olympiads.</p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58600:205"/>
                     <p>That in the Romane affairs (a moÅ¿t important piece of HiÅ¿torie) the ConÅ¿ulÅ¿hips are not regiÅ¿tred in the <hi>FaÅ¿ti</hi> with that diÅ¿tinction and care as was neceÅ¿Å¿arie, experience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath been made by the induÅ¿trious examinations of <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> and <hi>CuÅ¿pinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the HiÅ¿torians themÅ¿elvs generally did not conÅ¿ider Å¿o much the deÅ¿ignation of Time, otherwiÅ¿e then with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their own <hi>Aera</hi>'s, which were but uncertainly fixt.</p>
                     <p>That manie of them wrote not the HiÅ¿torie of their own Times.</p>
                     <p>That Å¿om of them took libertie to relate thoÅ¿e things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ively, which others related excluÅ¿ively.</p>
                     <p>That Å¿everal Nations reckoned not by the Å¿ame form of years. That all Nations not ChriÅ¿tian, affected an Opinion of greater Antiquitie then their own beginings, endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore to leav the Storie of their riÅ¿ing as poÅ¿Å¿ibly uncertain to poÅ¿teritie, as in them laie. So the <hi>Egyptians</hi> tell us of Heroes paÅ¿t, who by their reckoning reigned long before the world was made; which they Å¿aie with as much credit, as the Indians tell us, that they have out-liv'd four Suns alreadie, and that this which wee have is the fifth from their begining: To Å¿aie nothing of <hi>Janbazar TÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> and <hi>Roani,</hi> men that lived before <hi>Adam's</hi> time, as the book <hi>HeubattiÅ¿h</hi> make's report, and that one <hi>SombaÅ¿her</hi> was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tutor.</p>
                     <p>But the greateÅ¿t cauÅ¿ of all is for that ProfeÅ¿Å¿ed Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers of our own times, Å¿uch as <hi>Funccius, Beroaldus, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholcer,</hi> nay <hi>Satian, Baronius, Torniellus,</hi> and <hi>Gordon</hi> themÅ¿elvs were altogether unacquainted with anie Artificial waie of this work, not knowing how to make application of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Civil Characters to the aÅ¿Å¿uring of Times. One of the firÅ¿t who began to know what was to bee don in this matter, was the moÅ¿t learned, and perceiving <hi>Mercator,</hi> who InÅ¿tituted a Chronologie by waie of DemonÅ¿tration AÅ¿tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical. To this begining, Å¿omthing by <hi>Crentzeim</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but verie much more by <hi>Bunting</hi> the Autor of a moÅ¿t elaborate Chronologie, demonÅ¿trating by the Characters
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58600:205"/> of EclipÅ¿es, the Sun and Moons Circles, and with Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of everie EclipÅ¿ Å¿ince the world began.</p>
                     <p>But this Art hath received greateÅ¿t perfection from that excellent work of <hi>Scaliger de Emendat. Temporum,</hi> upon whoÅ¿e grounds <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> hath erected a moÅ¿t incomparable Chronologie for demonÅ¿tration of time by Eclipfes, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Sun and Moon Å¿everally applyed to everie year, yet wanting Å¿o much to accompliÅ¿hment as may Å¿eem to bee added by the incredible pains of <hi>Helvicus;</hi> who excelleth <hi>CalviÅ¿ius</hi> (though otherwiÅ¿e excelled by him) in Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿mes infinitely added, and the application of the Julian Period, which why <hi>Sethus CalviÅ¿ius</hi> Å¿hould not meaÅ¿ure is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much to bee marvelled. TheÅ¿e two therefore put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up Chronologie everie waies abÅ¿olute, and brought to Å¿uch a perfection as needs not to bee added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; for though I doubt not, but that even thoÅ¿e alÅ¿o are Å¿omtimes failing, as for Å¿om other neceÅ¿Å¿arie and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defects; Å¿o alÅ¿o for that they are not throughly advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, whoÅ¿e Tables AÅ¿tronomical they beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely may follow. Yet I aÅ¿Å¿ure my Å¿elf the differences cauÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed by this is but verie Å¿mall and inÅ¿enÅ¿ible, that it cannot bee much amended though never Å¿o much care Å¿hould bee taken, and that by tampering it may bee made much worÅ¿, as by the learned, infinite and equally unprofitable pain of <hi>Petavius,</hi> is too well known. Therefore good it were, that Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie brought to this degree of complement, might exÅ¿pect no extremer hand, but beeing Å¿tampt with the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿om publick autoritie, might go currant in general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without farther clipping or defacing upon whatÅ¿oever Å¿pecious and pretending reformations.</p>

                     <hi>Monarchie,</hi> as the PhiloÅ¿opher diÅ¿courÅ¿eth in his Politicks, is the government of one man over manie. According to the degrees of this Principalitie, the word <hi>Monarchie,</hi> is equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; in the prime meaning intending <hi>The Lawful AbÅ¿olute Rule of Å¿om Prince, either Elected or Succeeding, exerciÅ¿ing Dominion correÅ¿ponding with the Law of Nature, and the Right of Nations.</hi> Thus His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred MajeÅ¿tie is a Monarch or Å¿ole Governor within theÅ¿e his Realms.</p>
                  <p>In a wider and unjuÅ¿ter Å¿enÅ¿, A <hi>Monarchie</hi> is taken for <hi>The Peremptorie Autoritie of Å¿om Mightie Potentate, whoÅ¿e Right and Title for the moÅ¿t part is his Sword;</hi> or, if hee hee Succeed, 'tis in the Ambition and Tyrannie of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, by which hee uÅ¿urpeth power where hee pleaÅ¿eth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58600:208"/> Å¿triking into the hearts of Men rather the fear then the love of him, whereby hee enforceth his unwilling VaÅ¿Å¿als to an unnatural Obedience.

                     <p>Once everie year, all mariageable Virgins were brought by that officer into the Market-place, and there Å¿et to Sale; if they were beautiful, the faireÅ¿t to thoÅ¿e that gave moÅ¿t: when all the beÅ¿t were thus beÅ¿towed, the Monie which was paied in for them, was given to the reÅ¿t which were not Å¿o comelie and meritorious in their beautie; everie one beeing Å¿upplied with a dowrie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to her want: By this means it came to paÅ¿s, that Å¿till the Gentrie and moÅ¿t wealthie amongÅ¿t the Men had the faireÅ¿t among the Women, they beeing beÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to buie them and to keep them.

The truth is <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth that his forerunner in this conceit was <hi>George Syncellus,</hi> a Monk. This <hi>George</hi> was learned but (in the opinion of <hi>Scaliger</hi>) a moÅ¿t Å¿evere Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and CenÅ¿orious judg of <hi>FuÅ¿ebius Pamphilus,</hi> whoÅ¿e Chronologie hee tranÅ¿cribed and examined.

Wee Å¿hall forbear to Å¿eek to Å¿ave his credit, by diÅ¿covering Å¿o much of his infamie: but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on why hee thus did, was to rectifie the errors of <hi>Affricanus,</hi> whoÅ¿e Chronologie though it will no waies hold in all points, yet it beÅ¿t agreeth this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58600:234"/> waies; for if wee reÅ¿tore him his four Kings again hee himÅ¿elf will bee found Å¿ubject to greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and more abound in AnachroniÅ¿ms, then before. This I then rather incline to, for my own particular, becauÅ¿ I have conÅ¿idered, that though <hi>George Cedren</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿eth himÅ¿elf in the firÅ¿t page of his work, conÅ¿tantly to follow the aforenamed <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> yet in this matter hee refuÅ¿eth him: at once acknowledging and leaving his error, for <hi>Cedren</hi> plainly Å¿etteth down our Patriarch born in the 43 of <hi>Ninus</hi> as aforeÅ¿aid.

                     <head>Of the Meridian without the Globe.</head>
                     <p>THe BraÅ¿s Meridian is divided into 4 equal Parts or Quadrants, and each of them Å¿ubdivided into 90 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that is 360 for the whole Circle. The reaÅ¿on why this Circle is not divided into 360 Degrees throughout, but Å¿till Å¿topping at the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and then again begining 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. is, becauÅ¿ the UÅ¿es of this <hi>Meridian,</hi> Å¿o far as in Degrees they are concern'd, require not above that Number. As for an Example: One uÅ¿e of the <hi>Meridian</hi> is to Å¿hew the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole,</hi> but the <hi>Pole</hi> cannot bee elevated above 90 Degrees. Another is to Å¿hew the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> or DiÅ¿tance of a Place from the <hi>Equator,</hi> which alÅ¿o can never exceed the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the Circle; for no Place can bee further diÅ¿tant from the <hi>Equator</hi> then the <hi>Pole,</hi> which is juÅ¿t that Number of 90 Degrees.</p>
                     <p>Upon one of the North Quadrants of this <hi>Meridian,</hi> of Å¿om <hi>Great Globes,</hi> the <hi>Climes</hi> are Å¿et to the Å¿everal Degrees of <hi>Latitude;</hi> and the Length of the longeÅ¿t Daie under the Å¿everal <hi>Climes:</hi> which (if the Geographers would think Å¿o) might very fitly bee placed on the <hi>LeÅ¿Å¿er Globe</hi>'s; for it were but dividing a Quadrant of the wrong Å¿ide of the <hi>Meridian</hi> into 90 Degrees, and there would be room enough. In Å¿om other <hi>Globes</hi> the Climes are caÅ¿t into a Table, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured upon Å¿om void Å¿pace of the <hi>Globe.</hi> But the DiviÅ¿ion upon a Quadrant of the <hi>Meridian,</hi> is much more artificial, as hereafter Å¿hall bee underÅ¿tood. And the reaÅ¿on why a North Quadrant onely need to bee divided, is, becauÅ¿ for the <hi>Climes</hi> of the Southern <hi>Latitude</hi> the reaÅ¿on is the Å¿ame. And the reaÅ¿on why the DiviÅ¿ion is made upon a North Quadrant rather then the South, is, becauÅ¿ our <hi>Globes</hi> are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58600:248"/> fitted for our Selvs, and all our Å¿hare of the Earth lieth in the North <hi>Latitude.</hi>

                     <p>FRom the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Ends of this <hi>Meridian</hi> a Å¿trong <hi>Wyer</hi> of BraÅ¿s or Iron is drawn, or Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to bee drawn (for the Artificers do not alwaies draw it quite through) by the Center of the <hi>Globe</hi> repreÅ¿enting the <hi>Axel</hi> of the Earth. The North End whereof Å¿tandeth for the <hi>North,</hi> the South End for the <hi>South Pole</hi> of the Earth. Upon the North End, a Å¿mall Circle of BraÅ¿s is Å¿et, and divided into two equal parts, and each of them into twelv, that is, twentie four in all. This Circle is the onelie one above the <hi>Globe,</hi> which is not imagined upon the Earth, but is there placed to Å¿hew the hour of the daie and night, in anie place where the Daie and night exceed not 24 hours: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>Cyclus Horarius.</hi> The <hi>Hour Circle,</hi> for which purpoÅ¿e it hath a little BraÅ¿s pin turning about upon the <hi>Pole,</hi> and pointing to the Å¿everal hours, which therefore is called the <hi>Index Horarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Å¿mall Circle is framed upon this ground, that in the <hi>Diurnal Motion</hi> of the Heaven 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi> riÅ¿e up in the Å¿pace of everie one hour, that is 360 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or the whole <hi>Circle</hi> in the Å¿pace of 24. So that the <hi>Cyclus Horarius</hi> is to bee framed to that <hi>CompaÅ¿s,</hi> as that everie 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of it, or one hour is to bear proportion to 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equator</hi> below it. And Å¿o in turning the <hi>Globe</hi> about, one may perceiv, that while the Pin is moved from anie one hour to another, juÅ¿t 15 Degrees of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> will riÅ¿e up above the <hi>Horizon</hi> upon one Å¿ide, and as manie more go down below it on the other Å¿ide. But this <hi>Circle</hi> is not much for the <hi>Geographer's</hi> uÅ¿e.</p>

                     <p>THe other <hi>Great Circle</hi> without the <hi>Globe</hi> is the <hi>Horizon;</hi> upon which (yet not as due to this Circle more then anie other, but becauÅ¿ there is more room) the <hi>Geographers</hi> Å¿et down the 12. Signs with their Names and Characters.</p>
                     <p>And becauÅ¿ everie Sign of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> containeth 30 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is 360 for the whole Circle, the <hi>Horizon</hi> is divided into 360 Degrees indeed as it ought, but not from 10, 20, 30, 40, Å¿o throughout, but by Thirties, that is, 10, 20, 80. and 10, 20, 30. and Å¿o along to make the diviÅ¿ion conform to the 12 Signs, to each of which, as I Å¿aid, is allotted the Number of 30 Degrees. And the reaÅ¿on of that is in reference to the Suns Annual Motion, in the CourÅ¿ whereof hee diÅ¿patcheth everie daie one degree under or over. So that hee paÅ¿Å¿eth through each of the <hi>Signs</hi> in, or in much about the Å¿pace of 30 Daies. So that, though Å¿om of the 12 Moneths, anÅ¿wering to the 12 <hi>Signs,</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿t of one Daie more then thirtie, and one of 2 Daies leÅ¿s, yet take them one with another, and the Daies of everie Moneth correÅ¿pond to the Å¿everal Degrees of everie <hi>Sign,</hi> or without anie conÅ¿iderable difference. And after that rate, or much about it, they are placed upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> to Å¿hew in what Degree, of what Sign the Sun is everie daie of the year. And to this purpoÅ¿e there is Å¿et down upon the Å¿ame <hi>Horizon</hi> a <hi>Calendar,</hi> and that of three Å¿orts in Å¿om Globes: Of two in the moÅ¿t, the one whereof is called the <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Old,</hi> the other the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> or <hi>New Accompt,</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this latter 10 daies before the former, and the third Å¿ort, where it is found, thirteen. Now though it bee true that the greateÅ¿t part of that which is written upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> more nearly concerneth the <hi>CeleÅ¿tial</hi> then the <hi>TerreÅ¿trial Globe;</hi> yet it is not altogether unuÅ¿eful here: and eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it will bee nothing out of the <hi>Geographer</hi>'s way to take along with him the ground of Difference in the 3, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the 2 Å¿orts of <hi>Calendars.</hi>

                     <p>This uncertaintie brought Å¿o much confuÅ¿ion upon the Old <hi>Romane Calendars,</hi> that <hi>Time</hi> with them was grown a Commoditie, and bought and Å¿old at a price.

As for Example: Let the year begin at the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> or Spring: In the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's time that fell out to bee at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but now this year it fell out upon the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 13 daies back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Å¿omwhat more, and Å¿o if it bee let alone will go back to the 1 of <hi>March,</hi> and 1 of <hi>Februarie,</hi> till <hi>EaÅ¿ter</hi> com to bee on <hi>ChriÅ¿tmas Daie,</hi> and Å¿o infinitely.</p>
                     <p>To reform this difference in the Accompt, Å¿om of the later <hi>Romane BiÅ¿hops</hi> earneÅ¿tly endeavoured. And the thing was brought to that perfection it now Å¿tandeth in (Å¿o much as it is) by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in the Year 1582. His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> (whereof <hi>Lilius</hi> was the chief) adviÅ¿ed him thus: That conÅ¿idering there had been an Agitation in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> Å¿omwhat concerned in this matter upon the motion of that QueÅ¿tion about the <hi>Celebration</hi> of <hi>EaÅ¿ter:</hi> And that the Fathers of that AÅ¿Å¿emblie after due delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the AÅ¿tronomers of that time, had fixed the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58600:250"/> Equinox</hi> at the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and conÅ¿idering alÅ¿o that Å¿ince that time a difference of 10 whole daies had been paÅ¿t over in the <hi>Calendar,</hi> that is, that the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> or Spring; which began upon the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> had prevented Å¿o much as to begin in <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s daies at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Å¿ame, 10 daies difference or thereabouts; they adviÅ¿ed that 10 daies Å¿hould bee cut off from the <hi>Calendar,</hi> which was don, and the 10 daies taken out of <hi>October</hi> of that Year 1582, as being the Moneth of that Year in which that <hi>Pope</hi> was born; Å¿o that when they came to the 5 of the Moneth, they reckoned the 15, and Å¿o the <hi>Equinox</hi> was com up to it's place again, and hapned upon the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> as at the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But that <hi>Lilius</hi> Å¿hould bring back the <hi>Begining</hi> of the Year to the Times of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councel,</hi> and no further, is to be marvelled at. Hee Å¿hould have brought it back to the Emperor's own time, where the miÅ¿take was firÅ¿t entered, and, inÅ¿tead of 10, cut of 13 daies; however this is the ReaÅ¿on why theÅ¿e 2 <hi>Calendars,</hi> written upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> differ the Å¿pace of 10 daies one from the other. And as the <hi>Old Accompt</hi> was called the <hi>Julian,</hi> from the Emperor; Å¿o the <hi>New</hi> is called from <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Lilius</hi> the chief Agent, the <hi>Gregorian</hi> or <hi>Lilian Accompt:</hi> and the <hi>Julian</hi> is termed the <hi>Old Style,</hi> the <hi>Gregorian</hi> the <hi>New,</hi> as in the converÅ¿ation of Letters betwixt Us and ThoÅ¿e on the other Å¿ide of the Seas wee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv; Theirs to Us bare date (for the moÅ¿t part) Å¿uch a daie of Å¿uch a Moneth, <hi>Stylo Novo;</hi> Ours to them Å¿uch a daie, <hi>Stylo Veteri:</hi> And Theirs may bee dated <hi>There,</hi> by their Accompt, and received here, before they were written by Ours.</p>
                     <p>For the third <hi>Calendar</hi> there need not much bee Å¿aid, though it bee more abÅ¿olute then the Å¿econd; for it redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Beginings of the Year to the Emperor's own Time, and Å¿o leaveth the <hi>Old Style</hi> 13 daies behinde as it ought to do.

                     <p>The <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>Charlton</hi> is 52 Degrees, 3 Minutes; that of <hi>London</hi> much about the Å¿ame. Here the proportion of 60 <hi>Miles</hi> to a Degree, will over-reckon the <hi>Distance</hi> almoÅ¿t by the half. The reaÅ¿on whereof Å¿hall bee firÅ¿t reported out of the Nature of the <hi>Sphere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However it bee certain, that the <hi>Artificial Globe</hi> (as the <hi>Natural</hi> is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to bee) is of a Form preciÅ¿ely round, and may bee drawn upon all over with <hi>Great Circles</hi> Meridional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet conÅ¿idered from the <hi>Middle Line</hi> to the <hi>Poles,</hi> it hath a Å¿enÅ¿ible <hi>Inclination</hi> or <hi>DepreÅ¿Å¿ion</hi> of <hi>Sphere,</hi> as it is termed in their words, Å¿o that if the <hi>Artificial Globe</hi> bee turned about upon it's <hi>Axel,</hi> Å¿everal parts of the Å¿ame Bodie Å¿hall bee more Å¿wiftly moved then other at the Å¿ame time; for it is plain, that the <hi>Equator</hi> is moved about in the Å¿ame duration of time, as the Å¿malleÅ¿t <hi>Parallel,</hi> but the <hi>Circumferences</hi> are of a VaÅ¿t and ViÅ¿ible DiÅ¿proportion, and therefore is not poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible they Å¿hould go an equal pace.</p>
                     <p>It is upon the Å¿ame grounds, that the Autor of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿e of the Globe per Terram mobilem</hi> will tell you, that in the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motion of the Earth, though <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (in the Å¿ame <hi>Latitude</hi> with <hi>Oxford</hi>) keep pace with the IÅ¿le of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> under the <hi>Line,</hi> yet they are of a very different diÅ¿patch; for <hi>AmÅ¿terdam</hi> goeth but 548 Miles in an hour, whereas the IÅ¿le of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> poÅ¿teth over 900 Miles in the Å¿ame Å¿pace of time, which is after the rate of 12 Miles in a Minute, and more. And all this is true (that is true to the <hi>Paradox</hi>) from the Inclination of the Sphere: But more plainly yet.</p>
                     <p>Wee Å¿ee that the <hi>Meridians</hi> upon the <hi>Globe</hi> are Å¿et at 10 Degrees DiÅ¿tance, but wee may perceiv too that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance groweth leÅ¿s and leÅ¿s, as the <hi>Meridians</hi> draw nearer towards their concurrence in the <hi>Poles,</hi> as the <hi>Globe</hi> it Å¿elf doth from the <hi>Equator</hi> upwards, and therefore the Degrees however accounted proportionable, yet cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly bee equal in the LeÅ¿Å¿er <hi>Parallels</hi> to thoÅ¿e in the <hi>Equator,</hi> but muÅ¿t needs make an orderlie Diminution from thence to either of the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When therefore it was formerly Å¿aid that 60 Miles of the Surface of the <hi>Earthlie Globe</hi> anÅ¿wer to a degree in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

So that if I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Longitudes</hi> of the <hi>Molucca's,</hi> or anie other parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Line</hi> into Miles, it is but multiplying the Degrees of <hi>Longitude</hi> by 60 and the thing is don; but if I would do the like by <hi>Oxford,</hi> or anie other place betwixt the <hi>Equator</hi> and the <hi>Poles,</hi> I muÅ¿t firÅ¿t know what number of Miles anÅ¿wereth to a Degree in that <hi>Parallel</hi> of <hi>Latitude.</hi> The knowledg of this dependeth upon the proportion which the <hi>Equator</hi> beareth to the <hi>Parallels,</hi> which is learned out by the skill of <hi>Trigonometrie,</hi> but need not now bee Å¿o hardly attained to; for the Proportions are alreadie caÅ¿t up into a <hi>Table</hi> by <hi>Peter Appian</hi> in the firÅ¿t Part of his <hi>CoÅ¿mographie.</hi> They are there Å¿et down according to the Rate of <hi>German</hi> Miles, one of which maketh 4 of ours.

It muÅ¿t not Å¿eem Å¿trange if I tell you that you may diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the more certain from the doubtful by their dÅ¿convenience, for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58600:267"/> where you finde them to agree, you have cauÅ¿ to Å¿uÅ¿pect (for the moÅ¿t part) that they have lien long upon the Lees of Time, not as yet enquired into. But if you finde them to diÅ¿agree, you may conclude that they have been brought to a new Examination. And of theÅ¿e, you are to take the lateÅ¿t, and from Å¿uch (if it may bee) as have don it by their own ObÅ¿ervation, as out of the Tables of <hi>Tycho</hi> before others. The difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> by <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Tables betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Norenberg</hi> is under 4 Degrees, which cometh neareÅ¿t to <hi>Kepler,</hi> who alÅ¿o took it himÅ¿elf from two Å¿everal obÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Moon.

                     <p>If you would convert the Degrees of <hi>Longitude</hi> into Hours (for this alÅ¿o may bee don as well into Miles) you are to allow 15 Degrees to one Hour, upon the ReaÅ¿ons taught before; and that which will bee gained by this is to know, by how much Å¿ooner or later the Sun RiÅ¿eth, or Setteth to one Place then to another. As the Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> betwixt <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Charlton</hi> is 79 Degrees, 30 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: that is, 5 Hours, 18 Minutes: and becauÅ¿ <hi>Charlton</hi> lieth WeÅ¿t from <hi>London,</hi> the Sun RiÅ¿eth Å¿o much Å¿ooner here then there.</p>

                     <p>It will follow from hence, that if the Picture of the Earth bee drawn upon a <hi>Parallelogramme,</hi> Å¿o that the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> bee equally diÅ¿tant throughout, and the <hi>Parallels</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended; the <hi>Parallel</hi> of 60 Degrees Å¿hall bee as great as the Line it Å¿elf<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and hee that coaÅ¿teth about the World in the Latitude of 60, Å¿hall have as far to go by this <hi>Map,</hi> as hee that doth it in the <hi>Equator,</hi> though the waie bee but half as long.

                        <hi>That this firÅ¿t Meridian is a great Circle rounding the Earth from Pole to Pole, and paÅ¿Å¿ing thorough the IÅ¿lands called</hi> Azores, <hi>and namely the IÅ¿le of S.</hi> MichaÃ«l, as the Å¿ame Noter to pag. 10.</p>
                     <p>Hee might think hee went upon a ground good enough; for in the Å¿eventh Chapter of the <hi>Introduction, Mercator</hi> himÅ¿elf, Å¿aith thus:</p>

                        <hi>Ptolomie hath placed the firÅ¿t Meridian in the Fortunate IÅ¿les; which at this daie are called the Canaries. Since, the SpaniÅ¿h Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots

                        <hi>Now wee muÅ¿t hold</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>that the Longitude is a certain Å¿pace or interval of the Equator cloÅ¿ed between Meridians, the one from the IÅ¿les called Azores, from whence it taketh the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the other, from that Place or Region, whereof wee would know the DiÅ¿tance.</hi>

                     <p>The like Note hee affixeth to the DeÅ¿cription of <hi>New-Spain:</hi> his meaning in both is, to let the Reader know that the DeÅ¿criber (who ever hee was) did not in theÅ¿e <hi>Maps</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Degrees of <hi>Longitude,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> from WeÅ¿t to EaÅ¿t, and from the <hi>Fortunate IÅ¿les;</hi> but from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t, and from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Toledo HiÅ¿paniae <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>mbilico;</hi> which is the meaning of <hi>Mercator,</hi> when hee Å¿aith, That Å¿om of the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> Pilots placed the Great <hi>Meridian</hi> in the middle of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58600:277"/> 
                        <hi>Spain.</hi> And if you look upon the <hi>Longitude</hi> in the North and South Å¿ides of the <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> you Å¿hall Å¿ee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees reckoned backwards contrarie to the received manner of <hi>Graduation.</hi> It is no verie hard matter to reduce theÅ¿e <hi>Longitudes</hi> to the ordinarie waie, but rather then Å¿o, you may have recourÅ¿ to the Later DeÅ¿cription of <hi>America,</hi> by <hi>Leat</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Scale,</hi> in particular <hi>Maps</hi> extending to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable portion of <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude,</hi> it dependeth for the ground upon the Degrees of the Great Circle, and the Proportion of Miles in Å¿everal Countries to anie Å¿uch Degree. But in LeÅ¿Å¿er DeÅ¿criptions it hath more to do with the known diÅ¿tance of anie two, or more places experimentally found, or taken upon truÅ¿t of Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                     <p>Here it is not to bee thought that the <hi>Longitudes</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> of all Places in a particular <hi>Chart</hi> need to bee taken, but of the Principal onely, the reÅ¿t to bee reduced by the <hi>Radius,</hi> the <hi>Angle</hi> of PoÅ¿ition, and the like; and much alÅ¿o in this matter uÅ¿eth to bee given to the Common Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; all which, the laÅ¿t eÅ¿pecially are the CauÅ¿Å¿es why the <hi>Maps</hi> agree no better, for of all other the Account of the Common People is moÅ¿t uncertain.</p>
                     <p>The French <hi>CoÅ¿mographer</hi> of <hi>Amiens</hi> before named, when hee took upon him to finde out how manie of their Leagues anÅ¿wered to a Degree, took his Journie from <hi>Paris</hi> as directly under the <hi>Meridian</hi> as hee might, till hee rode 25 Leagues according to the Account of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Place. <hi>Nec tamen vulgi Å¿upputationem Å¿atiatus</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>vehiculum quod</hi> PariÅ¿ios <hi>rectÃ¢ viÃ¢ petebat conÅ¿cendi in eÃ³que reÅ¿idens tota via</hi> 17024 <hi>ferÃ¨ rotae circumvolutiones col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legi, vallibus &amp; Montibus (quod facultas noÅ¿tra ferebat) ad aequalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem redactis.

His ergÃ² revolutionibus per quatuor ductis reperi paÅ¿Å¿us</hi> 68096 <hi>qui milliaira Å¿unt Italica</hi> 68, <hi>cum paÅ¿Å¿ibus</hi> 96. In his return to <hi>Paris</hi> hee took Coach, the Diameter of the Wheel was 6 foot and a little more, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58600:277"/> the Circumference 20 foot, that is, 4 paces. Hee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned upon the waie 17024 circumrotations of the Wheel, which multiplying by 4 the <hi>Numerus factus</hi> was 68006 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which amounted to 68 Miles <hi>Italian,</hi> and Å¿omwhat more. And yet according to Common Supputation they that reckon moÅ¿t, reckon but 25 Leagues to a Degree, and 60 Miles to 25 Leagues 8 Miles leÅ¿s. The <hi>CoÅ¿mographer</hi> addeth indeed, that by the Å¿ame experiment hee found, that the <hi>French</hi>-League was of a greater proportion then two <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Miles.</p>
                     <p>If it could bee exÅ¿pected that Å¿o exact a courÅ¿ might bee taken in all particular MenÅ¿urations, wee might put the more truÅ¿t in the diÅ¿tances, and yet you Å¿ee wee might fail too. It is enough in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e to know the reaÅ¿ons of thoÅ¿e uncertainties where the thing it Å¿elf is Å¿o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uperable.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of Miles in Å¿everal Countries is great, but it will bee enough to know that the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> are reckoned for all one, and four of theÅ¿e make a <hi>German</hi> Mile; two, a <hi>French</hi>-League; three, and Å¿omwhat more, a <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi>-League; the <hi>SwediÅ¿h,</hi> or <hi>DaniÅ¿h</hi> Mile conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of five Miles <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> and Å¿omwhat more.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Miles of Å¿everal Countries do verie much differ, Å¿o thoÅ¿e of the Å¿ame do not verie much agree: and therefore the <hi>Scales</hi> are commonly written upon with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna, Mediocria, Parva,</hi> to Å¿hew the Difference.</p>
                     <p>Of Common <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Miles 60 (as you know already) anÅ¿wer to a Degree of a Great Circle: 68 Å¿aith <hi>Fernelius:</hi> it ought to bee 63 and Å¿omwhat more by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter</hi> of the Earth, as it was taken by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
